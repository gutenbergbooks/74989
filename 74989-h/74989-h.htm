<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The central figure of this play is the writer of short stories known
to all the world as O. Henry. His name was William Sydney
Porter; “Bill” Porter to his intimates in the Ohio State Penitentiary,
where, beginning at the age of thirty-six, he served a sentence
of three years and three months for embezzlement of national
bank funds.</p>

<p class='c006'>This play follows, as literally as possible, the facts concerning
“Bill” Porter’s life and behavior in prison, as revealed in his letters
and other published records. The writer of the play has had the
advantage of much conversation with <a id='tn-al'></a>Al Jennings, who was Porter’s
intimate both in prison and previously in Central America, where they
had sought refuge from the law. Mr. Jennings, who appears as a
character in this play, has been good enough to go over the manuscript,
and the author here pays tribute to the kindness and genial
spirit of an ex-train bandit, ex-convict, ex-lawyer, ex-evangelist, and
almost successful candidate for governor of Oklahoma. Mr. Jennings
has written a book, “Through the Shadows with O. Henry,” published
by the H. K. Fly Company, also by the A. L. Burt Company.</p>

<p class='c006'>This play deals with the soul of a creative artist, working despite
ill fortune. Throughout the play there has been employed a convention
additional to those customary on our stage. Whenever colored
lighting is used, the scenes beheld and the characters appearing are
not real, but are the children of “Bill” Porter’s brain. They may
be persons who have previously appeared as real, but they are now
present in the thoughts of the hero. In this form they change, they
assume new personalities and take on new roles, in the magic chemistry
of art. Let no one be puzzled because these artist imaginings
mix up all times and places, the past and the present, the living and
the dead; for that is the way of the imagination. The play tries to
show a writer at work; how he takes the experiences of his life, and
revises and reshapes them according to his temperament.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stories of O. Henry alluded to in the play are as follows:
Act I, “A Municipal Report,” from the volume “Strictly Business”;
Act II, “A Retrieved Reformation,” from the volume “Roads of Destiny”—a
story better known by the title of the play which was made
from it, “Alias Jimmie Valentine”; Act III, “Holding up a Train,”
“Makes the Whole World Kin,” and “The Day We Celebrate,” from
“Sixes and Sevens,” and “The Fourth in Salvador,” from “Roads of
Destiny”; Act IV, “The Guardian of the Accolade,” from “Roads of
Destiny,” and “An Unfinished Story,” from “The Four Million.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Scene</span>: <i>The drug-store of the prison hospital.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>A long counter runs all the way across the stage, from right to
left, at the back part of the stage. On the far side of the counter,
away from the audience, the convicts file by, entering at the right and
going off at the left, having their orders for drugs filled by the clerk.
On the side of the counter nearest to the audience is the portion of the
room in which the drugs and supplies are kept, and in which the clerk
works. This portion has an entrance at right, to the hospital, and one
at the left, to a hall. At right center is a flat-topped desk, with a
chair facing left; another chair on the other side of the desk. All the
way under the counter, and along the walls at right and left, are rows
of shelves occupied by boxes and bottles large and small, as in an
ordinary drug-store. These shelves turn upon pivots, making possible
a quick change of the room, at the end of Act II and of Act IV, into
a bank.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>At rise</span>: <i>Those convicts who have listed themselves as sick are
getting their evening supply of drugs. They file along from right to
left, hard-faced, desolate looking men both white and black, clad in
the old-fashioned black and white striped convict suits. They shove
bits of paper over the counter, and take their pills or powders, for the
most part silently, sometimes with a grunt or a growl. A guard stands
by the door, watching them, a club in his hand; the guard wearing
blue uniform with brass buttons.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>Bill Porter, the night drug-clerk on duty, takes the prescriptions
and fills them silently and swiftly; they are all standard prescriptions,
which he has ready mixed and measured, and for the most part all he
does is to shove out two or three pills, or a powder folded up in blue
paper. He is a smooth-shaven, fair-haired man of thirty-seven, not
stout but well filled out, benevolent, but reserved in manner. He wears
a white hospital costume, clean, but old and worn. The Negro, Joe,
a trusty, is puttering about the place, making a pretense at dusting off
the contents of the shelves with a rag. He wears a dingy grey uniform,
with black stripe down the trousers.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>Biggins</i> (<i>next to the last man in the line; a lean, wiry street-rat
and pickpocket; he talks out of the corner of his mouth, so that the
guard will not detect him</i>): Say, Buddy, can’t yer give us somethin’
different from these here white pills?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I am filling your prescription.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Biggins</i>: Well, can’t yer wait till yer make yer rounds, an give
us somethin’ else?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: If you want me to prescribe for you, you’ll have to apply
when I’m making my rounds.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><i>Biggins</i>: Thanks, Buddy, fer the tip. The croaker’s been t’rowin’
dese here white bullets down me troat fer a month now—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Purzon</i> (<i>the last convict in the line; a big man, broad, beefy-faced,
noisy, who has passed worthless checks by posing as a ranchman</i>):
Cheer up, kid, there’s nothin’ in ’em but a lump of dough. (<i>he hands
over his slip of paper, and receives a couple of pills</i>). Don’t I get a
powder too? The croaker said I should.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: He didn’t write it down.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Purzon</i>: Well, for God’s sake, what kind of a deal is that? He
told me I was to have digitalis.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: There’s digitalis in one of those pills.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Purzon</i>: Well, they look exactly alike! A fat lot they care what
they feed you in this joint—that bonehead croaker don’t take as much
trouble as if he was keepin’ dogs.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>sternly</i>): Move along now. If you have any quarrel with
the doctor, say it to him.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Purzon</i> (<i>snarling</i>): Ah, you fat stool-pigeon!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Move on! I’ve never yet reported a man in this place,
but I’m not paid to listen to you abuse my chief.</p>

<p class='c013'>(<i>The guard, noticing the talk, approaches and pokes Purzon roughly
with his stick; the last of the line moves off.</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i> (<i>coming forward, humbly; a large, athletic-looking black fellow,
in the thirties</i>): Please, suh, Misteh Porteh, could you gimme a
little tention befo you shuts up de boxes?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: What is it?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Ah got what you might call a little inclination to de constipulation,
an Ah could use a couple of dem double-barrel shotgun
shells. (<i>as Porter shoves him a couple of pills</i>) Thankee, boss. (<i>he
resumes his pretense at dusting, and Porter puts the covers on his
boxes, and goes to his desk with a weary sigh</i>) Ah bet you is tahd
when you gets done wid dat line. (<i>silence</i>) Dey mussa been two hundred
men in dat line dis evenin. Dey keeps a comin an a comin, an it
doan seem to do em no good. (<i>he is inviting conversation, but Porter
sits at his desk lost in thought</i>) Misteh Porteh—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Well?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Dey sho is a lot of misery in dis place.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: There is.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Dey sho is one <i>mountain</i> of misery in dis place!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>looks at papers on his desk, crumples them up into a ball,
and makes as if to throw them into a wire trash-basket, which stands
at the side of his desk nearest to the audience; he discovers that the
basket is full to overflowing</i>): See here, don’t you remember my saying
anything to you about keeping a little room at least on the <i>top</i> of
this trash-basket?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Yes, boss, dasso. Ah’s powerful fogetful; but you does sho
fill up dat trash-basket! Seems like you spen de whole night writin
paper an tearin it up.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Have they made you custodian of the hospital stationery?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span><i>Joe</i>: No, boss, Ah’s only de custodian of de hospital trash-baskets.
But if yo jes wouldn’t roll em up into balls, so dey fill up so much room!
If you wouldn’t tear em into little bits, so dey spill out through de
holes!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I don’t care to have my writings read in this place.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Yes, boss, Ah understan; but make yoself easy—Ah cant
read a line of his hyar hanwritin.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Well, save me the job of nagging.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Yes, boss, Ah sho try. But you know how it is, if Ah was
a first-class rememberin niggeh, I wouldn’t be doin a term in de Ohio
State penitentiary, Ah’d be a spick and span porteh in a Pullman car,
jing-jinglin de quartehs in mah pocket. (<i>imitating car porter</i>) Nashville
de nex stop, suh! Brush you off, suh?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Quit your chatter and get out of here!</p>

<p class='c013'>(<i>Joe takes trash-basket and runs; Porter takes mail from pocket
and glances at letter; then sits in attitude of despair, his head in his
hands. Joe returns with empty basket, and begins to make a pretense
of sweeping the floor with a broom, at the same time peering at Porter,
trying to see his face.</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>without looking up</i>): Wouldn’t it be possible for you to
get this room swept before I come on duty?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Misteh Porteh, you dunno how dey keep me on de jump in
dis place—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: They seem to turn you loose at this precise hour every
evening, so you can come in and fill my lungs with dust.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Ah’ll jes keep a sorteh circulatin roun wid dis broom, so de
capn think Ah’m workin if he comes, but Ah wont make dust enough
to botheh you. (<i>Porter continues to sit in attitude of dejection; Joe
manifests first curiosity, then sympathy; he tries to attract attention</i>)
Ah-hum! (<i>Porter does not look up</i>) Ah-hum!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: What is it, Joe?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Misteh Porteh—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Well?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Ah’s got somethin else besides dis hyar constipulation.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: What you got?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Ah’s got somethin—you might call it a sorteh constipulation
of de vocabulary.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: How’s that?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Ah wuks roun dis hispital, an Ah keeps mah eyes open, an
Ah sees Misteh Porteh doan say much to nobody in dis place. Ah thinks
it oveh, an Ah thinks maybe he’d like it if Ah was to come up an say,
right still and quaht: Misteh Porteh, Ah’s jes a niggeh.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Indeed, Joe!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Dey got me in de penitentiary in de state of Ohio, Misteh
Porteh, but Ah was raised down in Tennessee, an Ah knows what a
genleman is; so Ah comes to you an says: Ah’s a niggeh.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Well, Joe, I’m glad you spoke. I won’t be so lonesome!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Ah wants you to know, <a id='tn-misteh'></a>Misteh Porteh, it warnt makin no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>trouble fo white folks what got me in his place. It was a black man
what Ah cut. Ah had a little yellah gal, an dat niggeh hadnt no business
to be foolin wid her. Ah wouldn’t a done him no real harm, if it
hadnt been dat he come on me so quick, Ah didn’t have a chance to
bend mah razor back. You knows how it is wid razors?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: No, Joe, I don’t think I ever fought with razors.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Well, you bends him back, all de way roun, an den you only
got bout a half inch of blade, an he doan cut so deep, you cant do no
real harm. But Ah mos cut dat black man’s neck through, so de jedge,
he give it to me hard. Ah says to him, Jedge, if you knowed what
Ah knows bout dat niggeh, you’d pay me fo service to de state of Ohio.
But it was a Yankee jedge, an he doan smile.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: He gave you life?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Not dat bad—twenty years. Ah reckons to git six years
an eight months off fo good behavior—an den, Misteh Porteh, Ah’s
goin back to de good ole state of Tennessee. Dey got me up hyar to
work in de steel mills—Ah thought Ah’d make some money an buy
me a tater patch an a mule; but Ah’s goin back home, wha dey knows
what a genleman is. You comes from de South, Misteh Porteh?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: North Carolina.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Ah knowed it! Dey was somethin in de way you looked at
me. Mah ole daddy belonged to de Jedge Adair famly. You ever
heah of de Judge Adair famly in Nashville? Ah lak to tell you bout
dat famly, Misteh Porteh, den you see Ah knows what a genleman is,
an how to talk to em.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Sit down, Joe.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Naw, suh, Ah reckon Ah keep circulatin dis hyar broom
roun jes a bit—de capn he might come a driftin in hyar, an you knows
how it is, Ah doan take no littlest chance fo to lose mah job as trusty—Ah
wants to spend dem extra six years an eight months in de state
of Tennessee, an not in de state of Ohio. Well, de Jedge Adair famly
was one of de tip-top families, dey was sho nuff quality. But den de
wah come, an you know how de Yankees come to Nashville, an de slaves
was free. Mah ole daddy wanted to stick by de famly, but dey couldn’t
keep him, dey didn’t have enough to eat fo dem selves. De Jedge
he died, an dey was only Miss Azalea Adair lef, an dey was dis fine
ole mansion all fallin in ruins, an dis fine lady livin in it an not
enough to eat. She done married a man—he jes married her fo to
live off what he thought she had, an when she doan have no money
he curse her an he strike her—yes, Misteh Porteh, an you knows what
would be goin on in de heart of an old slave what was raised in de
famly, an knowin things was goin on like dat, an Miss Azalea Adair
so proud, an hidin it all from de world. Well, mah ole daddy he got
out an work fo de Yankees and save up an buy him a hack an a horse,
an he drive, an make a little money, an when he know Miss Azalea
Adair not have anything to eat, he take her a dollar or two. An den
Major Caswell—dat’s de husban’s name—he find out she got dat money,
an he take it away from her, so he kin go down an show off in de bar-room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>of de big hotel, struttin roun an treatin all de genlemen what he
know. You ever hear anything like dat in de South, Misteh Porteh?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: No, I can’t say I ever did.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Well, Miss Azalea Adair she try all de time to find some way
to earn money. Dey had a great liberry in de house, an she read all
dem books, an got dem in her haid, an she begin to write. Of course,
de editors up Noth, day was glad to git what a great lady like Miss
Azalea Adair write, so dey sent a man down from New Yok fo to see
her an pay her money, an git her to sen some mo writin. An mah ole
daddy, he was de hackman what met dat Yankee man, an drove him
to Miss Azalea Adair’s home. It was a ole hack, de horse was so
weak he could hardly stagger—cause you see how it was, all de money
what de fares brung in had to go to keep Miss Azalea Adair alive.
Well, dat Yankee man, he pay Miss Azalea Adair fifty dollars fo what
she write, an den he go away. An Major Caswell—dat’s de husban—he
find out she got dat money, an he grab her by de wrist an twist it
till she mos faint—she too proud to make a soun, you know—an he
take dat money an sneak off. Mah old daddy, he peek through de do
an he see dat happen. He take de kitchen knife an sneak out an folleh
de Major—it was in de night, an black dark—an he stab him through
an kill him an take de money. Yes, suh, he was a white man, too,
but dis ole niggeh slave, he kill him.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: And did they catch him?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Mah old daddy? Naw, suh, boss, dey doan ketch him, he
die in his bed wid de preacher prayin oveh him an de angels a waitin
fo his soul. Maybe de police have some idea what happen, but dey
wasn’t anbody care much bout dat ornery Major Caswell. An Miss
Azalea Adair course she doan never speculate nothin, cause my ole
man he doan take her dat fifty dollars all to onst, he jes kinds string
it out, one or two dollars when he see day warnt nothin in de pantry.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: What a story! What a story! And you say—by George!
You say that happened in Nashville?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Yes, Misteh Porteh.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Well, now, that’s a funny thing. I was reading the other
day—here, I think I have it in these magazines—here’s a fellow who
says you couldn’t tell an interesting story about Nashville, Tennessee!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: What’s de matter wid Nashville?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: He thinks it’s too slow, too old-fashioned. Here’s what
he says. (<i>reads</i>) “Fancy a novel about Chicago or Buffalo, let us say,
or Nashville, Tennessee! There are just three big cities in the United
States that are ‘story cities’—New York, of course, New Orleans, and,
best of the lot, San Francisco.”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Well, Ah doan know nothin bout books, Misteh Porteh—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I know a little, and hope to know more. I’m writing
some stories, and maybe some day I’ll write that story about Miss
Azalea Adair. Is she dead?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Yes, suh, dey all daid.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I’ll quote that fellow who says you couldn’t write about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Nashville, Tennessee. I tell you Joe, you can write about any place
where human beings live—provided you know how to get into their
hearts and report what’s going on there; it doesn’t matter who they
are—white or black—or where they are—in jail, or in Nashville. A
story is a report on human hearts. I’ll call this one “A Municipal Report”;
quote the statistics about Nashville—all the commonplace
things, and then tell how I go there, and run into the old hackman
that was once a slave, and drives his tumble-down old rig to earn a
dollar, to buy food for his starving mistress in the mansion! I can
make them cry over that! (<i>a pause</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Misteh Porteh.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Well?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Somethin—Ah dunno if Ah’d ought to say it. Ah was in
dis room las night, when you got through wid sewin up dat feller
wid de busted haid—an you was all alone—leastways you thought you
was, an Ah didn’t like to make no noise. (<i>a pause</i>) Ah like to say
dis, Misteh Porteh, you doan have to feel shamed—dey’s lots o fellers
cryin in dis place. (<i>a pause</i>) Dey gits you locked up, an yo cell-mate’s
snorin—oh, den de tears come a runnin onto de pillow. You know,
Misteh Porteh, dey was a little kinky headed yalleh baby, de prettiest
little thing you ever see; Ah thinks what become of him, maybe he’s
crying tonight cause he doan get enough to eat—it jes seem like mo’n
Ah can stan.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: You were married, then?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Naw suh, we wasn zacly married—dis was a kindeh what
you might say engagement baby. (<i>grins</i>) But Ah guess Ah done loss
dat yelleh gal fo keeps now, she doan write to me, Ah reckon she got
some new felleh. (<i>a pause</i>) You got folks outside, Misteh Porteh?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I’ve got a little girl.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Sho nuff? Well, now! How ole dat little gal?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Eleven.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Her mammy daid?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Yes.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Dat’s hard! Dat’s sho nuff hard, Misteh Porteh! She got
folks takin care of her?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: She lives with her grandparents.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Ah wondeh, is you got a picture of dat chile?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Yes, I have. (<i>he opens drawer of desk and hands a photograph
to Joe</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Dat’s a pretty little gal! A sho nuff sweet chile! What
dey call her, Misteh Porteh?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Margaret’s her name.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Margaret. Dat’s a right nice-soundin name. Ah doan
wondeh you miss dat little lily. Do she know whah her pappy is?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: She has no idea.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Oh, doan you let nobody tell her, Misteh Porteh!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Never until I tell her with my own lips.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span><i>Joe</i>: Dat’s right, dat’s right! She’ll believe what her pappy
tells her. Ah bet it ain’t so bad as some folks made it look like.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: That is a question I never discuss with anyone in this
place.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Ah understan you, boss. Ah reckon you aint showed dis
hyar picture to many. But when a genleman from de South talk wid
a niggeh, it’s like he was a chile, talkin to his black mammy. Dat
little Miss Margaret got a ole mammy what take care of her?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Yes, Joe. (<i>he puts away photograph</i>) Every night I sit
here and write, and all the time I’m thinking of one thing, to get
enough money to send Margaret a present at Christmas. I didn’t have
anything for her birthday, and I’m sure not going to fail again! Miss
Azalea Adair will help me out.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: She’d a liked dat first rate, Misteh Porteh.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: What did she look like?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: She had white hair, an her dresses was old, but de laundrin
was new; a little lady, hardly anything to her; gentle an quaht—you
know what dem Southern ladies is.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: And your old daddy, tell me about him.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: He was a big black man, big as me; proud feller, his grandaddy
was a king in de Congo. Yes, suh, Misteh Porteh, suh, you
needn’t laugh, dat’s a fact; dey was lots o great men captured an sold
to be slaves. Uncle Caesar, dey call him, an he wore a long coat like
de ginrals in Ginral Lee’s army. It was ole and patched, an de rain
had washed it an de sun had faded it, but you could see it was a
ginral’s coat—gold lace an tassels on it, an when dey was all gone, mah
ole daddy he was boun to show it was a ginral’s coat, so he had mah
mammy sew on rope to make loops an tassels an eppilets an things.
An he would have to git himself tied up in it wid twine, cause all
de buttons was gone, only one las button up near de top, a fine yelleh
button, big as a half dollar. Yes suh, dat was a sho fine coat—Ah
reckon mah ole daddy he wear it befo de throne of grace, cause dey
done buried him in it. He stan by de do’ of de hack, wid his whip
in one han an a ole feather duster in de odder, an he make like to
dust off de seat of de hack, an he say: “Step right in, suh; aint a
speck of dust in it—jes got back from a funeral, suh. Kyar you anywhere
in de town fo fifty cents.” He sho knew how to git de money
out of genlemen.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I know, I’ve had them operate on me. I can see a whole
mob of them, lined up in front of a depot; they come charging at you—like
a race riot, a company of freedmen, or Arabs, or Zulus, armed
with whips.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Jes so, boss; jes so!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Uncle Caesar, as you describe him, might be the old
hackman who drove me and Miss Athol Estes, that summer night when
we ran away to get married. I was afraid the old hack would fall to
pieces at the next bump. We hadn’t very far to go—for Miss Athol
sang in the choir of the Presbyterian church, and the minister was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>good enough to marry us. One thing more; tell me what Major Caswell
looked like.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: De Major? He was one of dese fellers dat hunt roun in a
hotel lobby, like a starved dog lookin fo a bone. He would hit a
spittoon wid a squirt of tobacco juice farther’n any man in de place.
He was always fightin de war oveh—I heerd de Judge tell him once,
he was one of dese perfessional Southerners. He had a big face,
kindeh red an pulpy-like, an sleepy. I tell you who he look like, dat
convict feller what was cursin at de doctor jes now. You could take
him fo de Major on a dark night. (<i>a voice calling, <a id='tn-offstage'></a>off-stage right:
“Joe!”</i>) Da’s de capn! (<i>calls</i>) Yes, boss!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: See here, you black-skinned rascal, if you tell anybody
what we’ve been talking about, I’ll take the ebony hide off you!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i> (<i>grins</i>): Naw, suh, Misteh Porteh, suh, Ah knows mah place.
Us Southerners got to stan together. You lemme be yo body-servant,
Ah take care of you like you belonged to de Jedge Adair famly! (<i>moves
reluctantly towards exit</i>) You was in de drug business befo you come
hyar, Misteh Porteh?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: When I was a lad I worked five years in my uncle’s
drug-store.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Ah bet you like to member dem days!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: It was the little town of Greensboro. You know how it
is down South in the springtime, the sweet odor of the honeysuckle,
and the mocking-birds singing; this time in the evening there’s chairs
in front of the store, and the girls come in their white muslin dresses,
and the perfumes you sold them yesterday now make you kind of
drunk while you’re squirting out vanilla and strawberry flavors! And
Babe Harmony, clerk to the justice of the peace, has fetched his old
guitar. (<i>faint sound of music: “Carry me back to old Virginny.”</i>)
He’s singing wha de cotton and de golden taters grow—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i> (<i>waving his hands</i>): Oh, Misteh Porteh, doan tell me bout
dem things, you make me spen de whole night cryin! Ah got to
hustle, boss, Ah dassn linger, Ah doan want to spen dem extra six
years an eight months in de state of Ohio! (<i>runs off right; the music
continues faintly</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>sits at desk, in meditation</i>): A Municipal Report. Nashville,
Tennessee. What have I got about Nashville? That old atlas,
perhaps! (<i>digs out atlas from under a pile of books</i>) T-E—Tennessee—Nashville.
(<i>reading slowly</i>) “Nashville, a city, port of delivery, and
the capital of the State of Tennessee, is on the Cumberland River, and
on the N. C. &#38; St. L. and the L. &#38; N. railroads. This city is regarded
as the most important educational center in the South.” Umm‑m‑m‑.
“Nashville occupies a foremost place among the manufacturing centers
of the country. It is the fifth boot and shoe market in the United
States, the largest candy and cracker manufacturing city in the South,
and does an enormous wholesale drygoods, grocery and drug business.”
That’s bully! (<i>sits lost in thought; gradually the lights shift to pale
violet color</i>) Uncle Caesar! His grandaddy was a king in the Congo!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>(<i>Uncle Caesar enters at right, silently, like a ghost. Music: “Old black
Joe.” He is Joe, the convict, made up in the role of his old father,
with a woolly grey wig, a dilapidated coachman’s hat, and the extraordinary
“ginral’s coat” previously described. He carries a coachman’s
whip in one hand, and a feather duster in the other.</i>) He must have
got that coat from some Confederate officers. It was worn all through
the war, it has been in battles. And that one button, that yellow button,
big as a half a dollar, the last of the tribe, reminder of the dead
glory. He looks out for customers, he hunts them as his grandaddy
used to hunt heads in the Congo. He’s one of the crowd of hackmen—he
storms down on you like a race riot, a company of freedmen, or
Arabs, or Zulus, armed with whips!</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='tn-unclec'></a>(<i>Uncle Caesar looks about, with growing energy and excitement;
appearing to discover Porter, he stretches out the whip, crying</i>):
Kyar you anywhere in de town, boss, fo fifty cents! (<i>he dusts an imaginary
hack with his duster</i>) Step right in, suh; aint a speck of dust
in it—jes got back from a funeral.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Driver, take me to the home of Miss Azalea Adair.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Uncle Caesar</i> (<i>stretches out his arm, as if barring Porter’s way;
an expression of suspicion and enmity on his face</i>): What’s dat?
(<i>then, recovering himself, with blandishing air</i>) What you gwine da
fo, boss?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: What’s that to you?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Uncle Caesar</i>: Nothin, suh, jes nuthin. Only it’s a lonesome kind
of part of town and few folks ever has business out dah. Step right
in, de seats is clean.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: All right; if that old hack of yours don’t fall to pieces
at the next bump. (<i>a pause; Porter turns his eyes to the atlas, and
reads</i>). “The city has an area of 10 square miles; 181 miles of streets,
of which 137 are paved; a system of waterworks which cost $2,000,000,
with 77 miles of mains.” (<i>takes out his purse, rises, and offers Uncle
Caesar a half and a quarter dollar</i>) Here’s a quarter extra for you.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Uncle Caesar</i>: It’s two dollars, suh.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: How’s that? I plainly heard you call out: “Fifty cents
to any part of the town.”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Uncle Caesar</i>: It’s two dollars, suh. It’s a long way from de
hotel.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: It’s within the city limits, and well within them. Don’t
think that you have picked up a greenhorn Yankee. Do you see those
hills over there in the East? Well, I was born on the other side, in
North Carolina. You old fool nigger, can’t you tell people from other
people when you see ’em?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Uncle Caesar</i> (<i>grins</i>): Is you from de South, suh? Ah reckon it
was dem shoes of yourn fooled me. Dey is somethin sharp on de toes
fo a Southern genleman to wear.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Then the charge is fifty cents, I suppose?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Uncle Caesar</i>: Boss, fifty cents is right; but Ah needs two dollars,
suh; Ah’m <i>bleeged</i> to have two dollars. Ah ain’t <i>demandin</i> it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>now, suh; after Ah knows whah you’s from; Ah’m jes sayin dat Ah
<i>has</i> to have two dollars tonight, and business is mighty po.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: (<i>reaches for his pocket</i>) You confounded old rascal, you
ought to be turned over to the police. But you know; you know;
YOU KNOW!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Uncle Caesar</i>: Yes, boss, Ah knows; Ah knows; AH KNOWS!
(<i>bowing and scraping, slides into the background</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>returns to study of the atlas; reads</i>): “In November,
1864, the Confederate General Hood advanced against Nashville, where
he shut up a National force under General Thomas. The latter then
sallied forth and defeated the Confederates in a terrible conflict.”
That’s the history of it; but that wouldn’t satisfy Major Caswell. He’s
a professional Southerner. A good phrase! I know the type. When
he bangs the bar with his fist, the first gun at Fort Sumter re-echoes.
When he fires the last one at Appomattox, I begin to hope for a chance
to get away! (<i>Major Caswell enters right, silently; he is the convict
Purzon, made up as a Southern gentleman, with a string tie, a slouch
hat and a Prince Albert; he stands in shadow, barely visible; behind
him is the frail figure of a woman, still less visible</i>). But he twists
the wrist of a woman! The rat with the blabbing lip! (<i>the Major
turns upon the woman and enacts the role of twisting her wrist and
taking some money from her by force; she moans feebly</i>) But she’s
too proud to make a sound! She’s a Southern lady—God bless her—and
she hides her grief from the world! (<i>the woman sinks to the
ground, invisible in the darkness; the Major comes forward, holding
the money in his hand; he counts it with exultation</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>The Major</i>: Fifty dollars! A real haul that time! I can live
like a gentleman fo once. Step up, suh, say the word, suh, the drinks
are on me. The South comes back to her own! The guns of Fort
Sumter re-echo again! The Confederate General Hood drives the
damn Yankees in rout befo him, and Nashville is free once mo, a
place fit fo a gentleman to live in. What’ll you have, Colonel?</p>

<p class='c013'>(<i>Uncle Caesar has been crouching in the shadows, watching the
scene. He now <a id='tn-steal'></a>steals out with a butcher knife in his hand and leaps
upon the Major, who turns and defends himself, trying to hold the
Negro off. In the struggle the Major tears the button from Uncle
Caesar’s coat; as the Negro stabs him, he falls, clutching the button in
his hand. Uncle Caesar takes the money from him, and then steals off</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>has been watching the drama with excitement, now and
then gesturing as if he were directing the actions of the players; he
now advances, gazing upon the body</i>): Stabbed him to the heart!
A white man he was, and the old Negro slave killed him! But he
leaves a clue—see, the Major has torn the one last button from the
old Negro’s coat, and he holds that button in his dead hand! That’s
where I come upon the scene—I’ll be the man from New York who
brings the fifty dollars to Miss Azalea Adair. I discover how Major
Caswell robbed his wife; I know that the Negro will take the money
back to her; so I take that button out of the Major’s hand—(<i>he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>stoops and takes the button</i>) So when the police come and find the body,
they don’t know what to make of it! (<i>two policemen enter silently;
they discover the body, make a swift investigation, and then pick up
the body and carry it off, right</i>) And so the old Negro escapes, and
dies in his bed with the preacher praying over him, and the angels
waiting for his soul. And something has happened—(<i>exulting</i>)—a
drama! A real story—in Nashville, Tennessee! (<i>a pause</i>) Oh, they’ll
have to take that story! That’s a masterpiece, and I know it! I’ll
get money for that—and buy Margaret a real present. What’ll it be?
A pony, perhaps! No, that would cost too much to keep. It’ll be a
doll, the most beautiful doll in the very fanciest shop in New York.
Margaret, dear, how would you like to have a doll—a big one in a
pink crepe dress, with pink ribbons in her hair—and when you lay
her down she closes her eyes, and when you squeeze her she says
“Mamma!”</p>

<p class='c013'>(<i>Margaret enters, at left, moving softly, in dream fashion; a
frail, sensitive, eager child, dressed in white muslin; she carries the
big doll as described, and gazes at it with ecstasy. Music.</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Do you like it, dear?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i>: Oh, Papa, she’s so sweet! Just listen! (<i>she squeezes
the doll, which says “Mamma!”</i>) She says “Mamma!” Oh, I wish
Mamma could be here to hear her! (<i>runs to Porter</i>) But you’re here.
Papa! You’ve come back to me. Have you come to stay?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Yes, sweetheart, never to go away.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i>: Oh, Papa, I’ve missed you so! Why did you stay so
long?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: That’s a sad story, dear.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i>: They wouldn’t tell me a thing about it—where you
were or what you were doing.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Listen, dear, it’s hard for me to tell you, but I have to
tell you some day. You’ll never doubt Papa, will you?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i>: Doubt you, Papa?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: No, of course not. It’s something very cruel, and I hate
to make you unhappy, but you must know, you must! All those years—three
and more while Papa was away from you—they had put him
in prison.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i> (<i>horrified</i>): In prison!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Yes, dear. There were people who accused Papa of
taking some money that didn’t belong to him—money from a bank.
But listen, Margaret, dear, you’ll never doubt what Papa tells you—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i> (<i>wide-eyed</i>): Why, of course not, Papa!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I want you to know that Papa never got that money.
Other people got it and they blamed it on him. They ran the bank
carelessly, and Papa was never a good hand to take care of money,
you know. And Mamma was ill, we had many dreadful troubles.
When they accused Papa—oh, it was cruel, with things about it in the
newspapers, and Papa had to go into court, and be charged with it,
and have to tell things about other people that he couldn’t bear to tell.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>I ought to have gone, Margaret, dear, I ought to have faced it out
and told everything. But I always hated money so, and money matters—I
was on my way to the trial, and I fell into a sort of panic,
I just couldn’t face it, I went to New Orleans and took a steamer to
Central America. You remember the first time Papa was away, for
half a year—you were young then—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i>: I remember it, Papa. Mamma and I packed up your
overcoat, and some good things to eat, and sent them to you.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I had been traveling all over Central America and South
America and Mexico. First I thought I could get some sort of little
home there, and have you and Mamma come; but I couldn’t earn a
living there, and I was so unhappy. Then I learned that Mamma was
worse—at the very time she packed that overcoat she was hardly able
to move. So I got desperate, I didn’t care what happened to me, I
came back, and Mamma died in my arms. And then I gave myself up,
I let them take me and try me in court. I sat and hardly knew what
was happening to me; I didn’t say a word that I might have said in
my own defense. My heart was breaking, dear, but I couldn’t let you
know it—I had to pretend to be happy, and make jokes, and tell you
I’d be back soon—(<i>he sobs, and the child with him</i>) I had to tell
grandma and grandpa to hide from you where I was, and wait until
I came out. I wanted to tell you with my own lips, so you would know
Papa was innocent—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i>: Of course, Papa! Of course!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Oh, sweetheart, I can never tell you about that place,
and what I suffered there. Only one thing kept me alive—the thought
that some day I’d be with you again. All the time I was in the prison
I used to write stories—I was the night drug-clerk, I slept in the
day-time and was on duty at night, and I’d spend long hours writing
stories. Some of them were published—and do you know what I
spent the money for? To send presents to you! That lovely dolly—I
spent hours thinking about that dolly, and how happy it would make
you. I used to sit at my desk and imagine you with that dolly, all the
sweet things you’d say to it—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i> (<i>gazing enraptured at the doll</i>): Oh, such a sweet
dolly! Oh, Papa—did you know, when you lay her down she shuts
her eyes, and that makes it easy to play she’s asleep! And when you
squeeze her she says “Mamma!” Do you suppose I could teach her to
say “Papa”?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Maybe I can find another that will say “Papa!”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i>: And a baby dolly, and a mammy dolly to take care
of her! A whole dolly family! Oh! Oh! (<i>claps her hands</i>) And
Papa! Such a lovely pink dress! I’m going to make her an every-day
dress, because this is too fine except for parties.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Do you know what that dress reminds me of, Margaret?
The one your Mamma wore the day we were married.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i>: Tell me about it!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Well, you see, grandma and grandpa didn’t want Mamma
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>to marry, because she wasn’t well, even in those young days. But
we just loved each other too much, so we ran away, and were married
by the Reverend Mr. Smoot of the Presbyterian church, where
Mamma sang in the choir. It was a day in the summertime—in Texas;
I can see Mamma in the lovely pink crepe dress, soft and fluffy—</p>

<p class='c013'>(<i>Athol enters, right, as described, a frail delicate girl of eighteen,
wearing a pink dress to match that of the doll. Music: “Silver
threads among the gold.”</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'>She was the loveliest thing in the whole wide state of Texas that
morning—and Texas is a wide state, I tell you! I was thinking about
her last night, and I wrote: (<i>he reads from manuscript, and meantime
Margaret slips back into the shadows, and Athol comes forward, manifesting
pleasure in the words</i>). “The Bride! Word of words in the
epiphany of life and love. The scent of the flowers, the booty of the
bee, the primal drip of spring waters, the overture of the lark, the
twist of lemon peel on the cocktail of creation—such is the bride.
Holy is the wife; revered the mother; <a id='tn-gal'></a>galluptious is the summer girl—but
the bride is the certified check among the wedding presents
that gods send in when man is married to mortality.... Dear kind
fairy, please cut out those orders for money and 40 H. P. touring cars
and fame and a new growth of hair and the presidency of the boat
club. Instead of any of them turn backward—oh, turn backward and
give us just a teeny-weeny bit of our wedding trip over again. Just
an hour, dear fairy, so we can remember how the grass and poplar
trees looked, and the bow of those bonnet strings tied beneath her
chin.”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>rises and goes to Athol</i>): Dearest! You have come!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i>: For always, Will.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: For always, and for happiness.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i>: You’re going to be good to me, Will?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: With the goodness of a whole choir of angels, and the
choir of the First Presbyterian Church thrown in! The goodness of
a case of the finest old <a id='tn-silkvelvet'></a>silk-velvet Kentucky Bourbon, with due accompaniments
of sugar, mint and ice—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i>: Oh, Will, what a metaphor! You know what you promised
me about your fondness for Bourbon!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Let it be inscribed—a promissory note—on the back of
our marriage certificate.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i>: It is inscribed on my heart, Will—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: A few men dying, as you know.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i>: I hear that poor fellow, Jimmie Valentine, is laid
up again. Wonder how he hangs on.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: It’s a poor place for his kind of trouble.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i>: Yes, they all ought to be out in the sunshine. But
then they’d all run away. So what can you do?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I have no answer for that, doctor.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i>: They say Jimmie Valentine was a first-class safe-cracker.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span><i>Porter</i>: So he tells me.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i>: Used to make a specialty of opening a safe in a few
seconds, they say—he had a trick all his own. Well, he’ll have a chance
to try his skill on the golden gates.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Doctor, I’m told Valentine has an old mother outside, and
he’s never been allowed to see her. Have you any idea of the reason?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i>: I never have ideas on such subjects, Porter; I leave
them to the warden. I think you’d be well-advised to do the same.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Yes, sir; I understand you.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i>: Have those medical supplies come?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Yes. They’ll be unpacked and on the shelves before
morning.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i>: Those aspirin tablets made up?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: All ready.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i>: You know, Porter, we can buy such things made up,
if you prefer.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: No, sir, I’ve plenty of time—no complaint on that score.
I was brought up to percolate my own paregoric and roll my own pills.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i>: By the way, Porter—this is serious—I’ve been looking
into the matter of that missing alcohol; there’s more of it gone.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Is that so, doctor?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i>: Is there anybody you suspect?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Well, you know how it is in a prison, there are many
men who might take alcohol; but there’s no one I have any reason to
name.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i>: Well, it has certainly got to be stopped. I don’t
like the job of playing detective, but some one has to do it. I’ll slip
a little drug into the alcohol, and make somebody mighty sick.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I’ll do my best to watch, doctor; but you know I’m not
here all the time.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i>: I have an interesting dissection to do this evening.

<p class='c013'><i>Al Jennings</i> (<i>appears in doorway at left; a wiry little man, wearing
the uniform of a first-class prisoner—grey, with black stripes on
trouser seams; vivid red hair and a temper to correspond; warmhearted
to his friends, a trouble to his enemies</i>): Bill.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>turns and stares</i>): Why, Colonel! You’re out of the hole!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: I’m out, and promised a job in the postoffice! How do
you like me in my new dress? I’ve come to pay my thanks.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: To me?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: They tell me, Bill, that you had the main finger where
he had to listen. It’s not every convict has a chance to save his warden’s
life!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Colonel, you and I are insiders. What saved that warden’s
life was my bedside manner! Nature has endowed me with a
rare blessing, the ability to keep silent when I have nothing to say.
The warden was dying—yes, but dying of fright.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Men sometimes die of swallowing arsenic, Bill.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Fowler’s solution, it was, and he hadn’t taken enough to
kill. I gave him a dose of simplicity mixed with gall. I said: “Drink,
and you’ll be well.” He did, and he was.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: And then you said to him: “Warden, I have a friend
of happier days, who is having the soul wrenched out of him in solitary.”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I’ll tell you, Colonel; it’s fortunate that you have the
gift of the gab, and have provided me with biographical details to
touch the heart of even an Ohio politician. “Warden,” I said, “this
Al Jennings, this outlaw, this desperado whom the newspapers and
the railway detectives have hunted over two continents for ten years—this
Al Jennings was born outdoors in a mountain snowstorm; he
was suckled upon frost, he was weaned upon kicks and beatings, he
was a street rat, hunted through the alleys; he was driven into crime
by cattle thieves and political grafters—in the state of Oklahoma they
have such, Mr. Warden. His crimes were wholesome, outdoor crimes,
as one might say; lovely, picturesque, heroic deeds, which school-boys
will thrill to throughout all time. To hold up a transcontinental express,
and dynamite the baggage car, and ride all night through mountain
canyons with sacks of treasure at your saddle-bow; to gallop into
town with a fusillade of bullets, and gallop away with the inside contents
of a bank—that, Mr. Warden, involves an expenditure of ammunition
sufficient to constitute a war. A train-bandit may be a man of
true loyalty, who would die before he would throw down a friend.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Give Al Jennings a chance, and you’ll find him a valuable assistant;
and more than that, he’ll stroll into your office of an evening, and
produce for you an elaboration of anecdotal pyrotechnics to restore
the shining days of Haroun al Raschid and his Scheherazade.” That’s
what I gave him, Colonel.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i> (<i>deeply moved</i>): Bill, you can’t imagine what I’ve been
through in this place, it’s been a blazing hell. They’ve starved me
for months on end. We outdoor men, we fade away and shrivel in a
place like this. Look at me, Bill—what would I do on a horse? When
I first came in, and learned that you were here, and you never came to
see me, my heart died. Three weeks passed, and you didn’t come; I
thought, Well, he’s got a safe berth in the hospital, he’s not going
to risk it. Then, you were giving out the Sunday quinine, and you
slipped me a word under the guard’s nose—then I thought it over,
and realized the truth: Bill had always been so dignified, so reserved—he
couldn’t bear to have a friend see him in prison garb!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Colonel, I have buried the corpse of my grief; let us
not dig it up.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: All right; but let me say this: What you’re here for
I’ve never asked, but I’ve a suspicion they framed you.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Colonel, you have seen my incompetence when it comes
to matters of money, whether to gain it or to keep it. It is safe to
say that such a man would not be wisely placed in a bank.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Somebody put it over on you! And now they’ve put
the brand upon you, they’ve made you a convict!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>with excitement</i>): Don’t say it!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: But it’s true.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: It is not true! I am <i>not</i> a convict!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: What do you mean, Bill?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I refuse to wear the brand!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: But how can you help it?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: When I go from here I shall change my name, and no
one shall know me.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Men have tried that, many and many a time, but they
never get away with it; the story leaks, and then it’s worse than ever—some
scoundrel comes along and blackmails you, and you’re at his
mercy. Face it out, Bill, live it down.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Never, never! A man might as well die in this place,
and have the bumping of the wheelbarrow down that corridor for his
requiem. I will not go through life with that brand upon my forehead.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Well, Bill, our paths are different; I’m going to keep
my own name and be what I am.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: That’s the way for you, Colonel; you’re a great man, a
celebrity; you’ve had your picture in the papers, you can go upon the
stage, they’ll put you in that new device they’ve invented, the pictures
that move, and that they throw upon a screen. You’re a historical
figure—you’ll go down to the future with Robin Hood of Sherwood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Forest. But me—what am I? A drug-clerk, a newspaper scribbler,
a bank-teller who didn’t find as much money in his drawer as he
should have had. (<i>a pause</i>) Come over and see me, Colonel, when you
can get off, and tell me stories for me to write up.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: I’ll tell you stories of this prison! (<i>lowering his voice</i>)
For example, how I burned down the bolt-works!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>startled</i>): Oh, my God, man!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: It’s a fact.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Don’t say anything like that to me! I don’t want to
know things like that! If it should leak, you might think I was to
blame.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Never in this world. Bill. When two men have rambled
over two continents together, fleeing from the law—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Someone might overhear you, now! (<i>looks about fearfully</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i> (<i>coming closer and whispering</i>): It was that lousy
scoundrel, Hickson, the bolt contractor, that brought it on himself.
He pays the state thirty cents a day for the labor of us prison slaves,
and gets eight dollars’ work out of us. He promised me extra pay if
I’d raise the product of my machine, so as to show the others it could
be done. Well, I did it, and I went to him for my pay—just think of
it, he owed me twenty-five cents, and he was too dirty mean to pay
it! Told me to go to hell, and if I made any fuss about it, he’d have
me paddled and take the hide off my back. Well, first thing, I hurled
a monkey-wrench at his head; it missed him by half an inch, and
went through a plank. They paddled me for that. When I came out,
I spent a month intriguing to get two candles. I tested one of them
in my cell, to see how many hours it would burn; then I climbed into
the loft, and set the other in a lot of boxes and shavings, and set it
burning—I had it figured to start the fire in the night. Well, I heard
the alarm, and I danced for glee, and when the fire spread, and the
big bolt machines come crashing down from the fourth story, by
Jesus, I shrieked like I’d gone crazy. Half a million dollars that fire
cost Hickson, and he didn’t have a cent of insurance! Some day, when
I get out, I’ll whisper it in his ear, and he’ll wish he’d paid me that
twenty-five cents. How’s that for a story, Bill?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>gravely</i>): No, Colonel, I can’t use that story, I can’t
write about things like that. No, you’ll never find a word in my writings
about a prison, or anything that happens in a prison. I can’t
face such things, I don’t know what to do about them. I can only
suggest a little kindness to men, a little humor, hoping that some day
it may become contagious.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: I know you, Bill.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: You have had troubles, Colonel; I have had them also.
Underneath this room is the basement where they do their punishments;
I hear men screaming and moaning—night after night I have
to pace the floor and listen, helpless—I have to do my work to that
music. I suffer till I am dripping with perspiration—but I am merely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>one of the victims, it would be my turn next if I should interfere.
At first I thought I couldn’t stand it; but—it seems we underestimate
our power to endure. I have learned to go the rounds with the doctor,
as Dante traveled through the seven hells; I answer calls when men
have hanged themselves in their cells, or cut their throats, or bitten
the arteries in their wrists. Every night in this hospital at least one
man dies; they bring a wheelbarrow, and throw in the corpse, and a
sheet over it, and cart it to the dead-house—through that passage they
go (<i>indicating the passage across the stage, on the other side of the
counter</i>) I hear them—rumble, rumble, rumble—bump, bump—while
I’m trying to write. (<i>he pauses</i>) I have put a shell about me. I say,
I am not here; I do not belong in this world; I have nothing to do
with it; I live in my spirit, in my dreams. That is why I do not
permit you to call me a convict, or to say that I carry the brand.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Bill, let us fly away together, to those happy days in
Central America, before the law closed its tight fist on us!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Be once more that little scarecrow, clad in a battered
silk hat, and a dress-suit with one tail torn off, dumped out of the
surf on the coast of Honduras!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Be that grave, ample figure in a Palm Beach suit,
steaming and fanning yourself in front of the United States consulate!
You had your bedside manner with you that morning, Bill, in spite of
an overdose of aguardiente!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Ah, dio mio, but those were happier days than we knew!
If only your thirty thousand dollars had been dowered with immortality,
we might have been there now!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: The mistake you made, Bill, was when you wouldn’t
come with us to hold up that bank. If we’d had you, we’d have been
all right.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: You are joking, Colonel? In an emergency, I’d hardly
know the hind-end of a gun from the front. No, I couldn’t do anything
like that; I couldn’t threaten to shoot a man.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: You remember, I offered to let you hold the horses.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: No, I couldn’t even hold the horses. We had to part
company at that place.</p>

<p class='c013'>(<i>The Judge and Delacour enter at left, on the far side of the
counter, and stand listening. The Judge is an irascible elderly convict,
grey-haired, tall and lean; Delacour is a fat, pudgy, and pompous old
man. Both wear uniform of first-class convicts; both have decided
Southern accents</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>The Judge</i>: Ahem! Ah beg pahdon fo’ interruptin these joyful
reminiscences, but would it be possible fo’ us to have medical attention,
suh?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i> (<i>turns</i>): Well, look who’s here! The Judge! And
Delacour! Bankers’ Row moves to the hospital! Bill, have you the
pleasure of knowing these two gents?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Only professionally.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Permit me the honor. My friend, Mr. William Sydney
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Porter, my friend, Judge Gordon Powhatan, retired banker of Baton
Rouge, Louisiana. Also, my friend Anatole Richemine Carillon Delacour,
retired banker of New Orleans. Here are two careers which
prove to us the power of money in a great democracy! You and I,
Bill, did our robbing in thousands or tens of thousands; we are small
fish. But the Judge and Delacour are whales—they got away with
several millions apiece!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delacour</i> (<i>angrily</i>): Jennin’s, that is silly stuff!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: He let his bank down for two millions, and has it all
salted away—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delacour</i>: Ah tell you that is rubbish!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Therefore he never had to live on the range like you
and me; he has apartments in Bankers’ Row—palatial rooms with a
bed and desk and all modern conveniences—a valet to press his striped
trousers—mail three times a day—telegraph service direct from the
warden’s office—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delacour</i>: Nonsense, Ah tell you!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i> (<i>with teasing delight</i>): Money will buy anything in
prison, Bill—just as outside! Make yourself agreeable to these powerful
magnates, and they’ll invite you to the feasts they spread every
Sunday afternoon. Delacour has built a complete kitchenette behind
the walls of the postoffice, and there he waves his magic wand—all the
rest of the week your mouth waters at the memory of his sauces and
flavorings—red-hot with chili peppers, Creole style. The Judge mixes
drinks, and they’re Creole style, red-hotter!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: You gabble like a turkey, suh. I need medical attention,
Ah tell you.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: What is it, Judge?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Nothing but alcoholism, you may be sure—tasting his
own toddies before he serves them—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: Ah have a prescription, suh. (<i>hands paper to Porter</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delacour</i>: And Ah too. (<i>he also hands paper</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Invite Mr. Porter to the next meeting of the Recluse
Club, Judge.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: We should be honored by yo’ presence, suh.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>takes pills from a bottle and hands them to Judge; gives
Delacour a paper of powder</i>): There are your prescriptions. I shall
be pleased to come, Judge.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: Ah shall see that an extra plate is set.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delacour</i>: But fo’get the brayin’s of that jackass Jennin’s. (<i>they
start to the door, left</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: You know how it is, Bill, these old bags of money are
always frightened to death, they hide their gold, and lie about it—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delacour</i> (<i>in the doorway, shouts excitedly</i>): Rot! Rot, Ah tell
you, rot! (<i>they go off</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i> (<i>laughing heartily</i>): We shall have a circus with those
old banker boys! You know Raidler—my pal at the postoffice? A
great lad—a hold-up artist—used to be known as “the Oklahoma terror,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>but they shot him in the neck, and now he has trouble in navigating.
But his tongue is still alive, and he’s the terror of “Bankers’
Row”—kids the life out of the pompous old duffers. That fat dumpling,
Delacour, stole a fortune down in New Orleans, and Raidler gets
him crazy, talking about his vast wealth, and his power in the prison.
It really is a rotten graft, and they’re scared the story will leak out,
and break into the papers. (<i>becoming serious</i>) Well, Bill, I must be
moving. I have an errand for the warden. He had more than one
reason for letting me out of the hole, it appears. (<i>a pause</i>) You never
ask any questions, do you, Bill?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: You will tell me what you want me to know.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i> (<i>laughs</i>): Yes, of course. You know Jimmie Valentine?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I see him every night.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Well, Jimmie has a chance to get a pardon.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: What?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: So the warden says.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: What has happened?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Do you read the papers?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Yes.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Read about this Press-Post scandal?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I saw the headlines.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Well, here’s the biggest newspaper in this city, and
the officers have been plundering it, and mixing up the books; now the
treasurer has skipped town, and locked the papers in the vault, and
no one has the combination.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I saw that.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: The courts are helpless; they’ve got to open the vault,
and they daren’t use dynamite for fear of destroying the papers. So
there’s Jimmie’s chance.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: You mean, they want him to open it?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: The warden asked me what I thought of the possibility.
I said, “I’ll lay you a wager he’ll do it in less than thirty
seconds by a stop-watch.” “Will he have to have tools?” he asked.
“He don’t use tools,” I said; “he has a little trick.” “Will he consent
to do it?” “I don’t know that,” I said. “The state of Ohio has never
done much for him, you must admit.” I tried to bargain for a pardon.
I said, “Here’s a man that’s been in prison most of his life,
since he was ten years old. He’s dying of T. B.—had three hemorrhages
in the hospital. Surely it won’t hurt the state of Ohio to let
him die in his old mother’s arms.” The warden said, “Tell him I’ll
ask the governor for a pardon, and I think I can get it—at least, the
governor has never yet turned down a request from me.” What do
you think, Bill?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Well, Jimmie’s a peculiar fellow, you know.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: What the men here call a “stir bug”; got the prison
poison in his soul. But I know him better than anybody else; we
were on the range together. Jimmie was an alley-rat, like me; when
he was ten years old, he stole a loaf of bread or something, and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>sent him to the reformatory; when he came out, eight years later,
they had reformed him into a thoroughly qualified cracksman. Now
he’s a third-time offender—habitual criminal they call it—all privileges
denied—can’t write a letter or even get one, can’t see his poor
old mother—hasn’t seen her for sixteen years—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: That’s the ghastliest thing about it, Colonel.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: I know. The warden says he’s powerless; it’s the law
of this august state of Ohio.</p>

<p class='c013'>(<i>Joe enters, right, from the hospital; he has his broom and cleaning
rags, and approaches diffidently</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Well, Colonel, we on the inside see what you might describe
as the seamy side of the law.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Misteh Porteh, suh, would Ah botheh you if Ah was to empty
de trash-basket now, suh?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: You might do something else. See if Jimmie Valentine
is able to come here.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Yes, suh, right away, suh. (<i>hurries off right</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Did Jimmie ever tell you how he does that trick of opening
safes?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: It’s quite simple. He takes a file, and files his finger
nails across the middle right down to the flesh—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Oh, horrible!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: He lays the raw quivering flesh against the lock, while
he turns the dial with his other hand. His nerves are so sensitive
that he can feel the tumblers when they fall; so it’s just the same as
if he knew the combination. How’s that for a story, Bill?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: My God, I’ll never write anything like that! That’s too
horrible to think about!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Bill, there are men who would file one hand off to get
out of this pen. (<i>a pause</i>) At the time I tried to make my getaway,
Jimmie came forward to take the blame. Said he’d got the saws for
me, and tempted me to try it. Of course, he was lying, and the warden
knew he was lying; just the same, Jimmie got reduced to the
lowest grade, and that’s what brought him to the hospital, I guess.
I saw his mother for him, and told him about it, and Bill, he cried like
a baby! But the great state of Ohio can’t find any good in such a man.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: The great state of Ohio would seem to be lacking somewhat
in spiritual intuition.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i> (<i>enters, right; a tall, emaciated man of about forty;

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i> (<i>lets himself carefully into chair</i>): What’s the dope,

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span><i>Valentine</i>: What’s that?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Straight goods.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i> (<i>after staring at him</i>): What’s the son-of-a-bitch tryin’

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: He wants something, of course—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Spit it out.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: You know this situation of the Press-Post?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Oh, <i>that</i>! (<i>a pause</i>) So they want me to open the
vault for ’em!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: That’s it, Jimmie.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Close to forty years I’ve lived in the state of Ohio,
and here’s the first time they’ve had any use for me.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: The main finger asked me, could you do it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: I can do it all right. Yes, I can do it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: I made a bargain with him; he promises—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Al, you’re a good scout, but quit kiddin’ yourself.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: You won’t believe him?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: If I wanted to get out of this stir, just the last thing
in the world I’d ever do would be to open that vault.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: How so?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: And show ’em how dangerous I am? Why, Al, they’d
never sleep nights after that. They’d say, “This guy’ll have everything
we own!” Not on your tin-type, Al!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: The main finger knows you’re a sick man, Jimmie—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: If I’m well enough to open one, I’m well enough to
open two. The main finger knows that, and if he don’t, the newspapers’ll
tell him. Forget it son!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: He wanted me to put it up to you—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Sure, he knows you’re my friend—he’s a wise bird,
all right And I’ll do it, Al—don’t misunderstand me, I’ll do it but
I won’t kid myself. I’ll do it for your sake. I’ll say to him: “Give my
friend Al a square deal in this place; and Mr. Porter here—”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Don’t do it for me! I wouldn’t let a man do such a thing!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: You mean, filin’ my nails? Hell, what do you suppose
that amounts to, when you’re fixed like me? I’ll do it and glad to
do it for a friend. Lead me to it!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: I thought Bill would see a story in your stunt, Jimmie;
but he says it’s too painful.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i> (<i>looking at Porter with sharp interest</i>): Well, he’s
right. What does anybody want to read about things like that for?
People want to be happy, they want some reason fer goin’ on livin’. If
you put me in a story, Mr. Porter, put me like I might have been.
You wouldn’t think it to see me now, but I was a gay kid once; a
good-looker, and the girls all liked me—yes, and I decided to go
straight, too, but the bulls wouldn’t let me. There was a guy named
Varick, he had me in his note-book, and every time there was a job
pulled off, Jimmie Valentine was the first man he thought of; he’d
haul me up to headquarters once a week, till I got surly, like a dog
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>chained up. You may believe it or not, I don’t care—but the job I’m
here for was a job I never saw.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Jimmie, Bill here is right; there’s nothing in it for
you. Tell the main finger to go to hell.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: No, Al, let me do it. There is somethin’ in it—I’ve
just thought of it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: What’s that?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: It’ll please the old lady. She’ll read about it in the
paper, and paste it on the wall, and have somethin to look at the rest
of her life. You know how a mother is, she likes her son to be number
one, whatever he is—even a safe-cracker! Tell me, Al, you sure
she didn’t find out I was sick?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: I swore to her you were head of the machine-shop, and
the most useful man in the place.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: I might make the main finger send for her; but that
would be worse than nothin’, it would break her heart. I think of her
nights, I seem to feel her, wanderin’ round, lookin’ through the gates.
Poor old soul, she’s got nothin’ in life but me, and she’s over sixty,
and must be feeble. She sits all evenin’ lookin’ at my picture, kissin’
my old coat, prayin’ to Jesus fer my dirty soul. Gee, but it’s tough!
(<i>a pause. Joe is crying</i>) Well, this’ll be a wet party if we go on.
(<i>rises feebly</i>) What time does the show start?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Tomorrow morning, Jimmie.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: All right, Al, tell the main finger I’m game, but I
won’t kiss him. And get me a rat file, a good sharp one, with a lot of
bite. Good night, Mr. Porter.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Good night.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Lead me home, Joe. (<i>takes Joe’s arm and goes feebly
off right, to hospital. Porter sits with head in hands, staring before
him. Jennings stands silent, wipes a furtive tear from his eyes, and
then goes off, left, not daring to trust himself to speak</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>to himself</i>): If you ever put me in a story, put me like
I might have been. A gay kid—a good-looker, and the girls all liked
me. I decided to go straight too, but the bulls wouldn’t let me. There
was a guy named Varick—Varick—</p>

<p class='c013'>(<i>a heavy rumbling sound is heard, coming nearer; a burly convict

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>distracted</i>): Get out, Joe, I want to be alone! Don’t talk
to me now! Go along! Turn off that light.</p>

<p class='c013'>(<i>Joe backs away, but does not leave the stage; another rumble
is heard, another wheelbarrow crosses from right to left. Joe snaps
off the light. There is total darkness, and the increasing rumble of the
barrow, with the screams from below, gives opportunity for a quick
change of the set, as follows: Brass gratings rise up, above the counter
on the far side, the gratings having openings, making the cashier’s
windows of a bank. There is a gap in these gratings, where the counter
may be swung inward upon hinges, giving an entrance to the interior.
The shelves below the counter turn on pivots, so that they
now appear as bank furnishings. The shelves at the right side of the
room turn in the same way. On the left side the wall now appears as
the steel door of a bank-vault; this wall runs obliquely, cutting off the
back corner of the stage, so that the entire audience can see the steel
door, and when it swings open, can see partly into the vault. Joe
makes a quick change into the blue uniform of a bank porter. The
Judge enters and seats himself at the desk, made up as an elderly,
dignified bank president with white moustache and goatee. Delacour,
stout and pompous, places himself as cashier at the window. Dr. Walters
takes a place outside the gratings, as a bank customer. Porter
stands by the half-open door of the vault, watching the scene, as it
gradually comes into view by red light.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>The rumble of the wheelbarrow turns into the galloping of
horses’ hoofs; the screams from the basement become yells, off-stage
left; also revolver shots are heard. Full red light. Al Jennings,
mounted on a cow-pony, and clad in cowboy costume, with an arsenal
of guns, rides through the entrance to the bank, on the far side of
the counter, at left; he is bare-headed, with touseled red hair; carries
a revolver in each hand, aims one at the cashier, and waves the
other at the whole room. He is followed by Raidler, also in cowboy
costume, with guns</i>)</p>

his guns into the holsters, leaps from his horse, and clasps Porter’s

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Sure, anything for a pal of yours.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: No, Colonel, I’m sorry; I couldn’t even hold the horses.</p>

tears us apart. (<i>wrings his hand</i>) Well, good bye, old man, we’ll ride

Well, gentlemen, we’ve had an adventure. I think, after that,
we’re entitled to a drink. Gather round; I’ll mix them <a id='tn-redhot'></a>red-hot, in
Creole style. (<i>takes a quart bottle from his desk</i>) Mr. Porter, we’re
obliged to you.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i> (<i>pointing an accusing finger through the grill</i>): Just
a moment, here; I don’t like the job of playing detective, but somebody
has to do it. How does this man come to know that bandit?
(<i>silence</i>) I’ll tell you how; he’s an ex-convict.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: That is not true! (<i>with excitement</i>) No one shall say it
of me! I refuse to go through life with that brand upon my forehead!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i>: I was the doctor at the Ohio Pen, and I played the
detective on him there. Now I’m representing the National Bankers’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Protective Association. Varick is my name—Varick, do you get me?
Here’s my shield, if you want to see it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: Gentlemen, in a case like this the first duty of all loyal
Southerners is to have a drink. Joe, bring the glasses. Here comes
our able and highly respected shoe-merchant—(<i>Jimmie Valentine
enters the front room through the door at right; he is debonair and
jaunty, clad in an immaculate business suit, and carrying a suit-case</i>)
Gentlemen, meet Mr. James Valentine. I am happy to enliven the
festivities by an auspicious announcement. Mr. Valentine, the leading
shoe-merchant of our town, has become engaged to my daughter.
Let us drink to the happiness of bride and groom.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Just a moment, Judge; we’ll have to postpone that
liquor. The bride is coming.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: Indeed! We are honored! (<i>he puts away the bottle, and
signs Joe to put away the glasses. Faint music, the Lohengrin wedding
march. The light fades from red to pale violet. Athol enters at
right, in the same costume as Act I, and accompanied by Margaret, in
the same costume; also another child, a year or two younger</i>) Gentlemen,
my daughter, and her little nieces, my two grand-daughters. (<i>all
bow, with elaborate politeness</i>) To what do we owe this honor,
daughter?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i>: Jimmie has to take a business trip, and I’m driving him to
the depot. I’m tempted to go with him, Daddy. Wouldn’t I make a
nice drummer? (<i>she takes Valentine’s derby hat from his hand and
puts it on her head; picks up his suit-case from the floor</i>) My, how
heavy it is! Feels like it was full of gold bricks.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Lots of nickle-plated shoe-horns in there. Thought
I’d save express charges by taking them along with me. I’m getting
awfully economical.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: While you’re here, daughter, you must see our new safe.
Gentlemen, we’ve just had it installed, the very fanciest thing in the
county, and we’re proud of it. (<i>he swings the door and shows it</i>) The
vault is small, but this new patented door is a wonder. Three solid
steel bolts are thrown with one handle; it has a time lock, and once
that is set and fastened, we defy any safe-cracker in the land. Would
you like to examine it, Valentine?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Unfortunately, I don’t know much about safes; it
wouldn’t mean anything to me. (<i>he politely looks over the outfit</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delacour</i> (<i>to Dr. Walters</i>): Is there anything I can do for you?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i> (<i>who is leaning on the counter peering through the
railings</i>): No, I’m just waiting for a man I know.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i> (<i>playing with the door</i>): Oh grandpa, what nice shiny
metal! And what funny locks and knobs! Why do you have so many?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: They all have their uses. Bank burglars are cunning
rogues.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i>: Does it make a big noise when you shut it?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: It will, if you bang it, I guess.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span><i>Margaret</i>: Grandpa, can I shut the bolts and turn the knob, like
I learned to do for the old one?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: Yes, sometime, if you happen to be here. (<i>turns to Valentine</i>)
Valentine, while you’re in the city, I want you to get me a
case or two of that superfine Scotch whiskey you brought down last
time. I was just on the point of giving these gentlemen a sample of
it—the Creole style, red-hot. It will be a memory for them to carry
away from our town—(<i>he is interrupted by a loud clang, as Margaret,
having shoved the younger child into the vault in a spirit of play,
slams the door, shoots the bolts, and turns the knob of the combination</i>)
What have you done?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i> (<i>screams</i>): Oh, my God!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i> (<i>in terror</i>): Grandpa! I was just playing!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i> (<i>springs to handle and tugs at it</i>): That door can’t be
opened!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i>: Oh, Papa!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: The clock hasn’t been wound, nor the combination set!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i>: Oh, God save us!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i>: Grandpa, I didn’t mean—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: Hush! All be quiet for a moment! (<i>shouts</i>) <i>Child!</i> Listen
to me! (<i>faint scream of the child behind the door</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i>: Oh, the poor darling! She will die of fright!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Oh, dat po chile!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i>: Open the door! Break it down! Can’t you men do something?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: Heaven help us! There isn’t a man nearer than two
hundred miles who can open that door! My god, Valentine, what can
we do? That child—she can’t stand too long in there. There isn’t
enough air, and besides, she’ll go into convulsions of fright!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i> (<i>beats upon the door hysterically with her hands</i>): Oh, let
the child out!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delacour</i>: We’ll have to get some dynamite.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: You’re mad, man; it would kill the child!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i> (<i>turns to Valentine</i>): Oh, can’t you do something? <i>Try</i>,
won’t you?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i> (<i>looks at her with a soft smile</i>): Dearest, will you
give me that rose you are wearing?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Margaret</i>: What’s that for? (<i>she gives it to him</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i> (<i>stuffs it into his vest-pocket, then throws off his coat
and turns up his sleeves</i>): Get away from that door, all of you. (<i>takes
suit case, lays it on desk, and spreads out complete set of shining burglar’s
tools, in orderly fashion; he picks out a steel drill, and starts to
work on the door, whistling to himself as he works. All watch him in
silence; they look from one to another, and the meaning of their glances
is clear—they are realizing that Valentine is a cracksman. Dr. Walters
peers through the grill, watching with special intentness. Valentine
takes one tool after another, and finally throws back the bolts and
opens the door without a word</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span><i>Athol</i> (<i>catches the half-fainting child in her arms</i>): Oh, precious!
You are safe!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i> (<i>puts on his coat and goes to the passage through the
counter; he sees Dr. Walters standing, half blocking this passage, and
he smiles</i>): Well, Varick! Got round at last, have you? Well, let’s
go. I don’t know that it makes much difference now.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i> (<i>steps back to let Valentine through the passage</i>):
Guess you’re mistaken, Mr. Valentine. Don’t believe I recognize you.
Is that your buggy out there, waiting to take you to the train?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i> (<i>shouts</i>): Jimmie Valentine! Come back here and get
that drink before you go. I’ll mix it red-hot, in Creole style. Come
back, I tell you! (<i>Athol and the two children go off right; the light
shifts to red; the Judge produces his bottle, and Joe hastens grinning,
with glasses. Music and jingle of castanets; Espiritu de la Vina dances
on, singing</i>)</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Scene</span>: <i>The postoffice of the prison.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>The view is from the interior of the office. The counter runs
across the stage at the back, and there are two windows, with brass
grills, through which the prison inmates get their mail; large racks
with pigeon-holes at each side; these counters, including the racks
and windows, are built on hinges, to swing back, away from the audience,
making a large entrance, as described later. In the center of the
stage, towards the front, is a large table, with five chairs; an extra
chair in the room. On the left wall of the room, partly occupied by
shelves, a portion has been cut into, and a little kitchenette built in;
the wall is swung back on hinges, disclosing a gas oven, and shelves
for pots and pans, with stock of provisions underneath. An entrance,
left, and one on the other side of the room, right.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>At rise</span>: <i>Five members of the “Recluse Club” are having a Christmas
Eve celebration. The table is set with napery and silver, and remains
of a partly consumed meal, including a turkey. Christmas
wreaths and bunches of evergreens on the walls and hanging over the
table. The members of the club are seated as follows: Porter in the
middle seat, facing the audience; Jennings at his right and Delacour
at his left. On the right of Jennings sits Raidler, which places him
with his right side to the audience; the seat opposite to him, with left
side to the audience, belongs to the Judge, but the Judge is now standing
at the gas-oven, brewing a hot punch. All five of the men are in
that state of gaiety appropriate to a feast. They are all in their
prison costumes, save that the Judge has on a cook’s apron. Raidler
is a shriveled-up cripple, with crutches on either side of his chair. The
Negro Joe is present as a servant; he is not supposed to take part in
the laughter and singing, but does so furtively, and on sufferance. He
has got a drum-stick of the turkey, and gnaws it, occasionally sticking
it away in his pocket when called upon for service. All are singing</i>:</p>

me time fo’ the brewin’ of it, suh.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: That’s right, Judge, stand on your dignity.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span><i>Delacour</i>: Gentlemen, if you could have seen the time Ah had
gettin’ that turkey from the commissary clerk! “Do you think,” says
he, “that turkeys are runnin’ wil’ in the state of Ohio?” Said Ah:
“They appear to be flyin’ higher than any wil’ one on the top of the
Alleghanies.”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: If you get to thinking what you paid for this bird,
you’ll lose what you’ve swallowed.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: By God, it would be the first time a banker ever coughed
up anything good since the days of the first pawn-broker. Who was
he, Bill?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: The founder of the Medici family, in fifteenth century
Venice. The three balls were their family coat of arms.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i> (<i>to Delacour</i>): Hey, you old Medici, pass the raisins.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delacour</i>: Can it be you’re willin’ to eat what we provide?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Me? I live off the bankers, as they live off the rest of
the world.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Delacour, when you puff up like that, your eyes are like
two pale gooseberries imbedded in a mask of red putty. You have
stuffed yourself.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delacour</i>: Did you think Ah cooked that meal to watch <i>you</i> stuff
<i>yourself</i>?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: You’re the living image of one of the passengers in
my first hold-up, on the Santa Fe. It was at night, and this fat,
solemn snoozer had managed to get into his frock-tailed coat and high
silk hat—but all the rest of him was pajamas and bunions. When I
dug into his pockets, I expected to drag out a block of gold-mine stock
or an armful of government bonds, but all I found was a little boy’s
French harp about four inches long. It made me mad, and I stuck
the harp against his mouth. “If you can’t pay, play,” I says. “I
can’t play,” says he. “Then learn right off quick,” I says, and let
him smell the end of my gun-barrel. So he caught hold of the harp,
and turned as red as you, and blew a dinky little tune I used to hear
when I was a kid:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Prettiest little gal in the country—oh!</div>
      <div class='line'>Mammy and Daddy told me so.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I made him play it all the time I was in the car: some day, when you
and I get out, Delacour, I’ll call on your bank and teach it to you.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delacour</i>: Maybe you’ve already taught it to me. Maybe Ah
was that passenger.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Maybe he was!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i> (<i>with wide-open eyes</i>): Was you, boss?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: By God, I don’t know whether you’re joking or not,
you old pudding-bag!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Gentlemen, gentlemen, remember the spirit of this hallowed
hour. Ten million pairs of parents in the United States are
hanging up stockings for their little ones; at such a moment the hardest
heart turns to sentimentality, the trigger-finger of the grimmest
killer is stayed, the burglar becomes sociable—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span><i>Raidler</i>: Yea, Bill! Did I ever tell you how Jersey Pete ran into
the fellow that had rheumatism?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: If the story be in fit spirit for Christmas, let us have it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Jersey Pete was helping himself in a rich man’s bedroom,
when the guy woke up, and Pete covered him with a gun and
told him to hoist his hands. The guy raised his right hand, but he
says, “I can’t raise my left, I got inflammatory rheumatism.” “Hell,”
says Pete, “I’m sorry for you. It hits me in the same place.” “Did
you ever try rattlesnake oil?” says the guy. “Gallons of it,” says
Pete; “if all the snakes I’ve used the oil of was strung out in a row
they’d reach eight times as far as Saturn, and the rattles could be
heard at Valparaiso, Indiana, and back.” “Some use Chiselum’s pills,”
says the guy. “Fudge,” says Pete, “I took ’em five months. No good.
I had some relief the year I tried Finkelham’s Extract, Balm of
Gilead Poultices, and Potts’ Pain Pulverizer; but I think it was the
buckeye I carried in my pocket that done the trick.” So then they
got to be friends, and Pete helped the guy to get his duds on, and
took him out and blew him to a drink.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Bill will make a story out of that and I’ll swipe a few
stamps from the State of Ohio, and the editors will eat it up. They
love these sympathetic gunmen and soft-hearted bandits.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: The story reminds me! When do we get taken to get
a drink?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: Suh, the wassail waits! (<i>brings steaming saucepan of
punch to the table</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Hurrah! Hurrah!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Lead me to it!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: Let me infawm you, suh, this is no smuggled stuff, suh.
The essential ingredient is genuine old hand-made Clover Leaf ’59,
Private Stock. (<i>ladles it into glasses</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: No desert rat was ever thirstier.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delacour</i>: Save some for me, there!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i> (<i>sidles up with eager interest</i>): Jes a drap fo de niggeh,
Jedge, jes a drap. (<i>as he gets it</i>) Thank’ee, boss, thank’ee.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Give us a toast, Bill.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>All</i>: A toast! A toast!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>rising</i>): Gentlemen: to the ten million mothers and
fathers of families who are now occupied in filling stockings and
decorating trees in this our Christmas nation! To the ten million
little boys who have whispered a want, and are waiting in an ecstasy
of anticipation! To the ten million little girls who have asked for a
dolly, in a pink silk dress, one that shuts her eyes when you lay her
down, and when you squeeze her, says “Mamma!” May they have
their twenty million desires.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>All</i>: Hurrah! (<i>they drink</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: That seems far off from the Ohio Pen, Bill.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Not so far as you may think, Colonel. It is the Day
We Celebrate.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span><i>Raidler</i>: Give us another, nearer home.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Gentlemen: to one who celebrates his Christmas lying
on a hospital cot, fearing every moment the last hemorrhage that

<p class='c013'><i>All</i> (<i>at first taken aback; then, soberly</i>): Jimmie Valentine.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: And his pardon! (<i>a pause</i>) Boys, if he don’t get that
pardon, there’s going to be hell to pay in this place.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Right you are, Al!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: If there’s anything the men have been more stirred up
about, it was before I came in here.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i> (<i>hitting the table</i>): Well, by Jesus, he earned that pardon!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Surely he’s going to get it!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Sho, boss, he <i>got</i> to get it!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: If they’re going to give it, why don’t they? Are they
waiting for him to be dead?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: The warden says the governor promised.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Hell! The promise of a politician!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: I know this—there’s one man in the place don’t expect
it, and that’s Jimmie.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: I notice he talks about it every day, all the same.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: The Colonel is right about that; he is hoping, yet trying
not to admit the hope—because he can’t bear to lose it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Nobody has to tell me about that—I went with him
when he did the job. He’d have died before he let the main finger
see what was going on inside him; but he wants that pardon, and he
wants to see his old mother before his last hemorrhage.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i> (<i>indicating the Judge and Delacour</i>): Look at them two
old toads sitting there! All they’re thinking about is, how dangerous
to turn out a man that might be able to open one of their safes!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: Well, suh, you must admit, suh—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Admit nothing! You’re a pair of bloodsucking Shylocks.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Isn’t the poor devil dying?</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='tn-trick'></a><i>Judge</i>: Yes, suh, but he might teach someone else that trick—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Godalmighty, will you listen to that? Aint he had
chance to teach a hundred of ’em here? Aint the papers published
how he done it?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Boys, that was one of the prettiest sights you ever
laid your eyes on! Just as quick as you could move your fingers, he
turned that dial, and I held a watch on him—twelve seconds to a dot,
and he swung back the door. “There you are, gentlemen!” You should
have seen that crowd of reporters and politicians—you could have
bowled the whole row of them over with a feather.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Yes, and for a bunch of lying crooks in office! What
difference does it make to Jimmie whether one set of thieves or another
got that money? I’ve done jobs I’m ashamed of in my life, but
never anything as dirty as those fellows up there in the state capitol
do all the time. I’m not <i>their</i> kind of crook!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: I remember when I was on trial, a religious lady came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>to cry over me. She thought I was a sweet-looking little fellow, and
she said, “Can it really be, Mr. Jennings, that you are thief?” “No,
ma’am,” says I; “I’m a robber.” “And what is the difference, Mr.
Jennings?” “About forty-five years, <a id='tn-maam'></a>ma’am,” says I. But she didn’t
know what I meant.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delacour</i>: Mr. Jennin’s, Ah’m thinkin’ we have guided this conversation
into painful channels.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Give us some more punch, Judge.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: I am desolated to infawm you, suh, that’s all there is.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: <i>What?</i> You call that a celebration?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: I made it good and strong, suh.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Yes; but this is Christmas eve!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: And you agreed to bring the makings! Why, you grasping
old note-shaver, you skinny old white bond-worm—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: This is not Christmas at all, this is a swindle, a hold-up,
a crime! I’ll denounce you to the main finger!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: You know the danger, suh, if you get drunk in this place—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Drunk? Hell and blazes, what do you mean, drunk on
one glass of punch?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: How would you know when I’m drunk?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: The Colonel has certain standards of his own, Judge. If
he were drunk, the air of this room would be full of fluttering white
pigeons, emerging from those pigeon-holes now apparently full of
mail; every postage-stamp would become a shining red or green eye,
according to the denomination, winking cross-eyed if the stamp were
canceled; a pink classic nymph would emerge from yon doorway and
dance upon the table, treading lightly between the dishes; the tops of
the shelves would be traversed by a company of beribboned cats,
marching in stupendous aerial procession. A few things like that,
and the Colonel would know that Christmas had come to stay.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delacour</i> (<i>getting to his feet</i>): Mr. Porter, Ah would sho’ly like
to see those phenomena. Ah will see what Ah can do.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Hurrah for the fat boy!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Does your prison bootlegger work nights?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Delacour</i>: Ah’ll see about it. There are ways, and ways. (<i>exit
right</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: There’s graft for you! His money can get anything,
any time.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: You’ll manage to forgive his liquor, suh!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Oh, I’ll drink liquor any time I can get it; but all the
same, it’s a rotten graft. They’d put me in the hole if they knew I
was taking the stamps to mail out Bill’s stories to the magazines, but
the men that run this prison will let the big contractors steal tens of
thousands of dollars, and take their share of the rake-off. Oh, yes,
this is the sweet land of liberty—for the money-squeezers that live
in Bankers’ Row—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: Mr. Raidler has mounted his soap-box again!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Gentlemen, gentlemen; you are mixing your occasions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>This is not an election campaign, nor yet the grand and glorious Fourth
of July. Colonel, do you remember Hop-along Bibb, that charming
person we met in San Salvador, and how he mixed his celebrations
when he got liquor on board?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Tell the story, and cheer them up!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: A short tale and a merry one. Hop-along Bibb was down
and out, so he married himself to a snuff-brown lady who kept a rum-shop
in the Calle de los Forty-seven Inconsolable Saints. When his
credit was played out there, he went to work on a banana-plantation,
along with an English tramp by the name of Liverpool Sam. If you’ve
never been in a banana grove, gentlemen, it will be hard to imagine
what that means. The place is as solemn as a Rathskeller at seven
a. m. You can’t see the sky for the foliage about you, and the ground
is knee deep in rotting leaves. Hop-along and Liverpool slept in a
grass hut, along with red, yellow, and black employes, and there
they’d lie all night fighting mosquitoes and listening to the monkeys
squalling and the alligators grunting and splashing in the lagoon.
After they had been there a few months they had lost all sense of
the fugiting of tempus—there was nothing to tell them about the
seasons, so when they came back to town, and found the American
consulate all decorated with flowers and flags, they weren’t sure what
it meant. A preacher man took pity on their penniless estate, and
gave Hop-along two dollars and told him to celebrate the day; so they
bought a quart of rum, and got drunk under a cocoanut tree, and then
Hop-along decided to celebrate proper and patriotic, so he jumped
onto Liverpool and licked him to a frazzle and then dragged the remains
back to the preacher. “Look at this, sir,” says he—“look at
this thing that was once a proud Britisher. You gave us two dollars
and told us to celebrate the day. The star-spangled banner still
waves! Hurrah for the stars and eagles!” To which the preacher
answers: “Dear me! Fighting on this day of days! On Christmas
day, when peace on earth—” “Christmas day?” says Hop-along.
“Hell, man! I thought it was the Fourth of July!”</p>

<p class='c013'>(<i>a burst of laughter; they pound on the table</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Haw, haw, haw! (<i>then, discovering that he has attracted
attention to himself, he shrinks back abashed</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Bill, ’tis a sad thing to contemplate what drink will
do to the mind of a man.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Take my advice, Colonel; steer clear of it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: I say, let Bill write that story and earn the makings
for next Christmas!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: I wish that fat old financial parasite would come with

helps, and they lead Valentine to Jennings’ seat</i>)</p>

Just thought—like to be with friends. Buck me up.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i> (<i>in voice of grief</i>): Po Jimmie Valentine!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Something’s gone wrong!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: I let ’em take me to the dinin’ room; thought—cheer
me up—Christmas carols—singin’—Jesus Christ (<i>the corners of his
mouth drawn down, his voice becomes a snarl of fury</i>) Little Jesus—meek
an’ mild—angels singin’—heavenly child. Hell and damnation!
(<i>they divine something serious, and gradually an idea dawns upon

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: My God, Jimmie!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: What have they done?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Speak up, man!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Brought me the news—Christmas present—love and
mercy.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: You don’t mean it?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Yeah—guv’ner turned me down. No pardon—too
dangerous.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Who told you that?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: It’s in the papers. Somebody yelled it in the dinin’
room—broke up their Christmas carols. Men howlin’ like devils.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i>: Now ain’t that a horror?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: God damn the crooks that run this state!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Oh, po Jimmie Valentine!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Take it easy, boys—I expected it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i> (<i>strikes his fist on the table</i>): They kept the news for
today!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i> (<i>shaking his clenched hands in the air</i>): And you can’t
do a damned thing! You’ve got to take it!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Forget it, forget it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>rises suddenly, pale with anger</i>): This is the end for
me! I’ll stand no more! (<i>starts toward the door</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i> (<i>in alarm</i>): What do you mean, Bill?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I mean I’m going to have it out with the warden.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: What can you do?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: At least I can tell him what I think of him and his prison.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: No, no! (<i>general confusion of protest</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i> (<i>leaps up and stops him by main force</i>): Good God,
Bill, have you gone crazy?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I’ve watched the cruelty and the stealing and the rottenness
in this place till I’ve been sick at my stomach; I’ve kept my mouth
shut, I’ve looked out for myself and my own skin. But this is the
limit; I’m going to speak up for Jimmie, if it’s my last act on earth.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Forget it, Mr. Porter.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Bill, you shan’t do it. Hold him, Joe! Wait, and

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span><i>Joe</i> (<i>helping Jennings</i>): Naw, Misteh Porteh, naw suh!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Raidler</i> (<i>unable to move, but reaching over the table as if to help</i>):
Keep your shirt on, Bill!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Sit down, Mr. Porter—there’s nothin’ to that.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Bill, let’s take a knife off this table and cut our two
throats. Will you do that with me?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: What, Colonel?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Jimmie here would care, and Raidler, and half a dozen
other men in the place—all as helpless as he is, sitting here paralyzed.
Tomorrow we’d be buried, and in three days we’d be forgotten,
and the graft would be going right on. Bill Porter, who do you think
you are? What do they care for you?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I care for myself, Colonel.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: How much? My God, man, they’d take you down to
the basement, and tie you flat on your stomach, and beat you with
paddles till every inch of you was one black and bloody wound. Ain’t
that right, Jimmie?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Sure it’s right—he knows it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: They’d give you the water—stuff a hose in your mouth,
and fill you till you fainted and turned black all over! Are you ready
for that?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Come, sit down, Mr. Porter.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>weakening</i>): Colonel—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Bill, you can’t go up against this machine—you’re not
built of that kind of stuff. Wait till you get out—then tell somebody
if you want to; but there’s nothing you can do now, you’ve got to
swallow your grief—this time, like all the other times. Come back
here, Bill, and sit down. (<i>leads him to his seat; the door opens, right,
and Delacour enters with a quart bottle in his hand</i>) Ah! Our banker
friend arrives—just in the nick of time! Here, Bill, this is the remedy—an
old remedy, tried and true, for the troubles a man can’t endure.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Valentine</i>: Sure—give him a drink.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i> (<i>takes the bottle from the Judge</i>): What’s this label
say? “Spiritus frumenti.” A nice, pious medical label! Down in
Latin-America, you remember, they call it “Espiritu de la Vina.”
There too they sometimes have troubles more than mortal flesh can
stand; and they know Dr. Barleycorn’s old-established remedy. (<i>he
pours a glass full</i>) Drink, Bill, take it quick, take it raw, and slide into
oblivion. When you come out again, things will be duller, your grief
won’t weigh so heavy, you’ll have a headache and a fuzzy tongue and
a few other things to think about. (<i>presses the glass upon him</i>) Down
with it! For Jimmie and me, if not for yourself, Bill! (<i>as Porter
drinks</i>) There, that’s better! That’s the philosopher! (<i>as Porter
drains the glass and sinks back into his chair, Jennings pours the

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Fellow members of the Recluse Club, the shore which
I select for our meeting is one you come to as you sail south from
Galveston, fleeing from the bloodhounds of the law. Our great master
of literature, Bill Porter, has described it in one of his immortal compositions,
which I have this day been privileged to read. (<i>takes manuscript
from pocket and reads</i>) “A clump of banana plants interposed
their broad shields between him and the sun. The gentle slope from
the consulate to the sea was covered with the dark-green foliage of
lemon-trees and orange-trees just bursting into bloom. A lagoon
pierced the land like a dark, jagged crystal, and above it a pale ceiba-tree
rose almost to the clouds. The waving cocoanut palms on the
beach flared their decorative green leaves against the slate of an
almost quiescent sea. His senses were cognizant of brilliant scarlet
and ochres amid the vert of the coppice, of odors of fruit and bloom
and the smoke from Chanca’s clay oven under the calabash-tree; of the
treble laughter of the native women in their huts, the song of the
robin, the salt taste of the breeze, the diminuendo of the faint surf
running along the shore.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Such is the coast of Honduras after you have had a sufficient
inoculation of the native aguardiente; otherwise it seems as I have
jotted down on the margin of this manuscript: “Take a lot of Filipino
huts and a couple of hundred brick-kilns and arrange ’em in
squares in a cemetery. Cart down all the conservatory plants in the
Astor and Vanderbilt greenhouses, and stick ’em about wherever
there’s room. Turn all the Bellevue patients and the barbers’ convention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and the Tuskegee school loose in the streets, and run the thermometer
up to 120 in the shade. Set a fringe of the Rocky Mountains
around the rear, let it rain, and set the whole business on Rockaway
Beach in the middle of January.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Fellow members of the Recluse Club, the day that Bill Porter and
I first met on that beautiful shore, I was a wonderful object for the
eye to behold. I had been attending a dinner-dance in the best society
of Galveston, when I got the tip that the minions of the law had the
house surrounded. I made my escape by a stratagem, and got aboard
a steamer in the Gulf of Mexico, clad in a silk hat and dress-suit; in
which costume I sailed for two weeks, battered in storms, and losing
one tail off my coat. So I was dumped out in the little town of Trojillo,
where I first saw our genial master of letters, seated in front
of the consulate, clad in spotless white. Recognizing our common condition
of fugitivity, we pooled our fates; I had thirty thousand dollars
sewed up in my belt which I had got with the help of two
sticks of dynamite, from the <a id='tn-wellsfargo'></a>Wells-Fargo express car on a Santa Fe
train. Together we went to worship at the shrine of the reigning
divinity of Central America, a lady called Espiritu de la Vina, to
whom they chant hymns by day and especially by night—(<i>he sings</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Gentlemen of the jury, the month of July found us in
Salvador, where we, as good American patriots, issued a declaration of
interference that the Fourth of July shall be celebrated with all kinds
of salutes, explosions, honors of war, oratory, and liquids known to
tradition. It so happened that there were Salvadoreans also panting
for liberty and liquids; there was a revolution planned, led by General
Mary Esperanza Dingo, who was some punkins both for politics
and color; but we had never met the general, and knew nothing about
these great events. We gathered the Americans of the town, with
their Winchesters, Colts and Navy forty-fives; we bought up all the
fireworks, and most of the fire-water, and early in the evening, as
soon as the thermometer had come down to 110, we started in at the
Saloon of the Immaculate Saints—the Cantina de los Santos Immaculatos—taking
all the drinks that bore American labels, and informing
the atmosphere as to the glory and preeminence of the United States,
and its ability to subdue, outjump and eradicate the other nations of
the earth. I had just thrown a bottle of ginger ale through a portrait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of Queen Victoria—or rather at a reflection of it which I saw in
a mirror over the counter of the cantina—when we heard yells outside,
and the galloping of horses’ hoofs, and a rattle of musketry. <a id='tn-asdes'></a>(<i>the
sounds are heard off-stage, as described; Jennings raises his voice</i>)
I shouted: “The infantry has turned out to do honor to the Fourth
of July! E pluribus unum! Viva la Libertad! The stars and stripes
forever!” We pulled out our shooting irons! Hurrah for liberty!
We opened fire on the lights of the cantina—</p>

<p class='c013'>(<i>Jennings pulls a gun from under his coat and fires at the lights,
which go out one by one at his shots, leaving the stage in complete
darkness. Shouts, singing, trampling, and general uproar, during which
a quick change is made. The wall which covers the kitchenette is
closed, concealing it from sight. The postoffice pigeon-holes and grilled
windows give outwards like double doors, leaving a large entrance to
the street of Salvador. The stage becomes a cantina, or drinking place.
Jennings assumes his costume of a battered silk hat and a dress-suit
with only one tail to the coat. The others don the white costumes of
Americans in the tropics. Red light gradually appears, revealing
Espiritu de la Vina dancing and singing, Porter watching and the
other five men, armed with rifles and revolvers, capering, shouting,
and firing shots through the ceiling of the cantina. Joe is hiding in
terror under the table.</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'>(<i>One of the guards seizes Margaret and carries her off right, crying.
The other two seize Porter and throw him down and bind him to
the floor. Joe makes pantomime of impotent despair. The guards
take the paddles and proceed to beat Porter. At the first blows the
light begins to fade, and after two or three blows the scene is in
total darkness. The sounds of the blows increase to heavy crashings,
and Porter’s moans rise to a general wailing and shouting, which
cover a quick change to the scene of the feast in the prison postoffice.
When the change has been completed, the sounds die away, and white
light breaks gradually upon the scene, revealing general disorder and
wreck. Delacour is asleep in his chair, his head thrown back and his
mouth open. The Judge has slid under the table. Jennings and Valentine
sleep with their heads bowed on the table. Raidler has had his
chair upset and is asleep on the floor. Joe lies on the floor at one
side, flat on his back. Porter sits leaning on the table staring before
him, brooding. It is Christmas morning, and off-stage there arises
the sound of fresh young voices singing a Christmas carol</i>)</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Scene</span>: <i>The drug-store, as in Acts I and II</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>At rise</span>: <i>The line of convicts is filing past the counter, as at the
opening of Act I, having their prescriptions put up by Porter. They
are in a state of angry excitement, with difficulty repressed by the
guards. Every man is moaning or snarling at every moment when the
guards’ eyes are not upon him. The guards move here and there,
threatening men with their clubs and commanding: “Silence! Shut
up there! Hold your tongue!” But at some other place in the line men
will shout, exclamations which are repeated again and again: “Jimmie
Valentine is dead! You murdered Jimmie Valentine! Liars! Scoundrels!
To hell with you! To hell with the state of Ohio! God damn
this prison! You killed Jimmie Valentine! Murderers!” Porter fills
the prescriptions, keeping tightly shut lips, but his hands are trembling,
and it is evident that he also is deeply moved. Joe is making
his usual pretense of cleaning up, but with difficulty, because of his
excitement; he turns this way and that as he hears the cries, and his
eyes are staring wide. Finally the last of the line is driven off, and
the roaring dies away to a murmur.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Gawdamighty, Misteh Porteh, de men in his place is sho
gone crazy! Dey is somethin goin to bust loose here tonight. (<i>Porter
makes no reply, but puts away his boxes and bottles</i>) Oh, dat po feller,
Jimmie Valentine! Didn’t even give him a chance to see his po ole
mammy! Misteh Porteh, did you hear what dey say bout her? (<i>silence
from Porter</i>) Dey say she’s stannin all day out by de gate in de snow.
Dey won’t even let her in to see de body; dey ain’t tole her when dey
gwine bury him. What you spose dey got agin dat po ole woman?
(<i>No answer</i>) Ah knows how it is, Misteh Porteh, you doan trust
yoself to open yo mouth bout his hyar business. Well, Ah seen times
when I’d missed a lot o trouble if Ah’d kep my mouf shut. Maybe
dis is one of em. Well, Ah go empty de trash-basket. (<i>takes the
basket and goes off left. Porter sits at his desk, staring in front of
him</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr. Walters</i> (<i>enters right</i>): Well, Porter?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Good evening, doctor.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr.</i>: Having trouble here this evening?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: A little noise.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr.</i>: Too bad! Too bad! A nasty situation. Looks as if it might
be worse before it’s better. What do you think?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I am here as an inmate, doctor; I am not supposed to
have opinions.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr.</i>: Humph! Discretion is the better part of valor. Well, have
you anything to report to me?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span><i>Porter</i>: I took the liberty of sewing up the head of a guard who
had a spike thrown at him.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr.</i>: Seems a good job; thank you.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Here is the week’s report. (<i>hands him paper; he takes
the paper and examines it. Joe appears at door, left, with empty trash-basket;
seeing the doctor he stops, and thus overhears the conversation
which follows</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr.</i>: By the way, another matter—not a pleasant one. (<i>he goes to
the shelf and takes bottle of alcohol</i>) This alcohol continues to disappear.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I don’t think so, sir.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr.</i>: You don’t? (<i>he holds it to the light critically</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I have had occasion to use quite a little of it on my
night’s rounds.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr.</i>: Indeed? (<i>a pause</i>) I think it will be advisable for me to go
with you on your rounds, and see how that happens.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Certainly, doctor. (<i>a pause</i>) There is something I will
say about that.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr.</i>: Well?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I hope you are not suspecting me of being a thief.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr.</i>: I have no right to do so; but it is my duty to try to make
certain about the matter. We cannot have drinking going on in this
institution, especially at such a ticklish time as this. I don’t like
the job of playing detective, but somebody has to do it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Doctor, I wish you to understand something that I have
never before talked about in this place. I am here because I was
accused of taking bank funds; but somebody else got that money—I
did not. I am taking what fate handed out to me, but I wish you to
know that I am not that sort of man.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr.</i>: I possess a normal amount of discernment, Porter, and I
appreciate your services in this position; it is not always easy to
find a registered pharmacist in a prison.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Thank you, doctor.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dr.</i>: Nevertheless, it will be my duty to go the rounds with you
this evening.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Very well. (<i>the doctor goes out, right, and Porter remains
seated at his desk, staring gloomily before him</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i> (<i>comes on, puts down the empty trash-basket, and begins
feeble pretense at dusting the bottles and boxes</i>): Misteh Porteh, you
didn’t see po Jimmie Valentine befo he died, did you? (<i>silence</i>) Ah
spose you jes couldnt bear it. Lordy, but mah eyes is sore wid all
dis cryin. (<i>silence</i>) Dat Docteh Walters is a stiff kindeh genleman,
aint he, Misteh Porteh? (<i>silence</i>) He say he doan like to play detective,
but he do it good, seem to me.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>sternly</i>): What do you know about that?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i> (<i>scared</i>): Ah was comin, Misteh Porteh—Ah had to come
in wid de trash-basket, Ah couldn’t hep hearin. Ah wasnt meanin to
spy—de Lawd knows <i>Ah</i> aint no detective, naw suh! (<i>silence</i>) But you

fo you; an Ah know dat Docteh Walters is a stiff kindeh genleman—he’s
a Yankee genleman, not like dey is in de South.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Get out of here now and stop your chatter.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i> (<i>goes right, towards the door into hospital; as he reaches the
door a low murmur comes from the next room, and rises to a clamor
of moans and protest; Joe looks off, then turns to Porter</i>): Oh, Misteh
Porteh, dey’s come to put dat po Jimmie Valentine in de wheel-barrow.
An dey aint let his po ole Mammy see him! Oh, dat po feller!
Oh, dat po feller! He’s daid an gone an dey goin to put him in de
wheel-barrow! (<i>his voice rises to a wail as he goes off right</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>puts his hands to his ears to shut out the sounds; his
manner indicating utter despair and breakdown</i>): Oh, God! Oh, God!
(<i>as the clamor from the next room continues, he rises, looks about him
cautiously, and then crosses to the shelf containing the bottle of alcohol.
He takes a glass and starts to pour some out</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i> (<i>reappears in doorway, right, and watches Porter, then runs
quickly to him in distress</i>): Oh, Misteh Porteh, naw suh, you mussnt
do dat, suh!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>angrily</i>): What the devil have you to do with it?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i> (<i>in frenzy of fear</i>): Oh, Misteh Porteh, suh, dat Docteh

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>draws himself up with dignity</i>): Joe, you are making a
presumptuous fool of yourself.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Listen, Misteh Porteh, suh, you aint quite yosef right now,
Ah knows how it is, suh, you mos crazy oveh what happen to dat po
Jimmie Valentine! But oh, suh, <i>please</i> suh—doan take it out o dat
bottle—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: You black ape, how do you know what’s in this bottle?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Ah knows, Misteh Porteh, Ah <i>sho</i> knows!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I thought you said you couldn’t read.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Hanwritin, Misteh Porteh, hanwritin. But Ah knows what’s
in dat bottle, cause Ah done tuck it mahself—many’s a time—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Why, you infernal scoundrel!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Befo you come hyar, Misteh Porteh, Ah tuck it. Not since
you come, boss. Ah wouldn’t do nothin to git you into trouble. Aint
you tole me Ah was yo body-servant, jes like mah ole daddy in de
Jedge Adair famly?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Was it the duty of the body-servant to run his master’s
life?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Yes, Misteh Porteh, hones, it sho nuff was. (<i>he grins</i>)
Misteh Porteh, lemme tell you story—a sho nuff true story, what
you kin write—it’s what mah ole daddy tole me jes befo he died—he
hadn’t never tole it befo, but he wanted me to know bout Jedge Adair
an de famly troubles. De Jedge, he was president of de Traders’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Bank, and de bank was gittin into trouble. Mah ole daddy he know
bout what was goin on, an he seen de Jedge was worried, he was
drinkin too much whiskey. An one night mah ole daddy had to go to
de bank, it was somethin what he had forgot to do, so he went at night—he
had a key, cause de Jedge he trusted him wid everything. Well,
mah ole daddy was in dah, and he heard someone a foolin wid de do’.
He thought it was a burglar, so he hid hisself, and who should he
see come into de bank but de Jedge hisself. De Jedge went to de
vault, an he open it, an he take out a suit-case and start to go off
wid it. Mah ole daddy he guess right quick what dat meant, de
Jedge was in trouble an goin to run away wid de money of de bank.
So mah ole daddy come out an speak to him an plead wid him fo de
honor of de famly not to take dat suit-case; and de Jedge, first he was
mad, den he choke a little, an he say, all right, an say no mo, an mah
ole daddy drive him to de depot an he go away widout de suit-case.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>puts the bottle back in its place and stands thinking about
the story</i>): Where did he go, Joe?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: He went fishin, Misteh Porteh.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Fishing!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Yessuh; he was a goin fishin wid Cunnel Gwathmey.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: But what did he want with the bank’s money if he was
going fishing?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Ah dunno dat, boss; maybe he meant to hide it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Did the judge ever admit to your father what he had <a id='tn-inin'></a>in
that suit-case?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Naw, suh, he doan never speak of it again.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: And your father never had a chance to look into it?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Naw, suh.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: And you say the judge was drinking too much?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i>: Yes, suh, dey was talk of it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Well, you ebony jackass, you woolly baboon! (<i>a chuckle</i>)
You wait, and I’ll write that story, and read it to you, and you’ll see
what it was Judge Adair left behind him when he went fishing with
Colonel Gwathmey!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i> (<i>puzzled, but pleased to have accomplished his purpose</i>): All
right, boss, Ah sho be glad to hear dat story. Yes suh, Ah be glad
to hear any story what you write, cause Ah sho been hearin a lot
bout dis writin you’re doin—(<i>sounds of shrieks from under the stage;

dis ruction! Us gotta stay here all night an lissen to em, Misteh
Porteh; you gotta stan it somehow!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>distracted</i>): Yes, I’ve got to stand it!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i> (<i>a fresh roar from the hospital, off right</i>): Oh, dat po
Jimmie Valentine! (<i>he goes to door and looks off</i>) Oh, dey got him
in de wheel-barrow! Dat po Jimmie Valentine, dey takin him to de
dead-house, an his po ole mammy aint seen him! (<i>the sound of the
wheel-barrow off right, approaching</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span><i>Porter</i> (<i>wildly</i>): Turn off that light, Joe. I can’t stand the sight
of it! (<i>he staggers to the desk, and falls into the chair, his head
buried in his arms</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Joe</i> (<i>switches off the light. His voice rises to a shriek</i>): Dat po
Jimmie Valentine! Dat po Jimmie Valentine!</p>

<p class='c013'>(<i>The wheel-barrow crosses from right to left, as in Act I. The
sounds of its bumping become thunderous; these sounds, with the
clamor from the hospital, the cries from under the stage, and the
wailing of Joe, cover a quick change to the bank scene as in Act II.
Joe exit. When the change is complete, the noise dies away, and violet
light appears upon the scene, disclosing Porter seated at the desk in
the bank, staring before him in deep thought.</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jimmie Valentine</i> (<i>enters, in his dapper business man aspect; he
greets Porter with quiet friendliness</i>): Hello, Mr. Porter.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>quietly, in half-dream fashion</i>): Hellow, Jimmie. (<i>pause</i>)
Jimmie, I’m a damned coward.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jimmie</i>: Oh, no, Mr. Porter.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I didn’t come to see you before you died, Jimmie; I
ducked on it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jimmie</i>: Oh, that’s all right, Mr. Porter, I understood that.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I just couldn’t bear it; I knew I’d break down, and I
ran away.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jimmie</i>: There wasn’t a thing you could do, Mr. Porter—it was
better to have it over with.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: And that poor old mother of yours, waiting outside at the
gate in the snow—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jimmie</i>: It wouldn’t have done any good for me to see her, Mr.
Porter. Nothing would really make her happy but to have me back
as a kid.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Life doesn’t do us that favor, Jimmie.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jimmie</i>: I know it. But I’m all right now. I’m going to marry
a sweet girl, and be vice-president of this bank before long. Would
you like me to show you how I opened the vault?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: No, Jimmie, no! That’s another way I was a coward; I
wrote it differently—I had you use a kit of tools.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jimmie</i>: That’s all right, Mr. Porter—that’s the way I wanted
it. People will see me like I wanted to be, and maybe that’ll help
some poor kid to keep straight. Write your stories that way, and
people will get some good out of them. Well, so long, Mr. Porter.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: So long, Jimmie. (<i>he rises and goes left, to wave Jimmie
off; after Jimmie has gone, he stands partly in the shadows; the light

right; he steps back into the shadows and stands watching as the
Judge enters, made up as Judge Adair, bank president, clad in long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>waterproof coat, waterproof fisherman’s hat, and carrying several
fishing rods, disjointed and wrapped in little cloth covers. The Judge
does not see Porter or Caesar, but sets his rods on the desk and goes
to the vault and turns the combination and opens it; he goes in and
comes out at once, carrying suit-case</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Caesar</i> (<i>having watched this procedure with signs of intense concern,

Sons and Daughters of de Burnin Bush, fo to kyar it to de meetin of

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: Humph! You better get home out of the night air. It’s

rheumatism. Think it’ll be a clear day, Caesar?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Caesar</i> (<i>terribly embarrassed and frightened, but summoning his
resolution and stammering</i>): Ah low it will, suh. De sun sot red las

Miss Lucy de queen?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: Tournament? Yes, I remember very well—but what the

long home, Caesar. I believe you’re sleep-walking.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Caesar</i>: Miss Lucy tetch you on de shoulder, wid a sword, an say:
“Ah mek you a knight; rise up, pure an fearless an widout reproach.”
Dat what Miss Lucy say. Dat’s been a long time ago, but me nor you
ain’t forgot it. An den dar’s another time we ain’t forgot—de time
when Miss Lucy lay on her las bed. She sent for Uncle Caesar, an
she say: “Uncle Caesar, when Ah die, Ah want you to take good
care of Marse Jedge. Seem like”—so Miss Lucy say—“he listen to
you mo dan to anybody else. He apt to be mighty fractious sometimes,
an maybe he cuss you when you try to suade him, but he need
somebody what understan him to be roun wid him. He am like a
little child sometimes”—so Miss Lucy say, wid her eyes shinin in her
po, thin face—“but he always been”—dem was her words—“my knight,
pure an fearless an widout reproach.”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: You—you old windbag! I believe you are crazy. I told
you to go home, Caesar. Miss Lucy said that, did she? Well, we
haven’t kept the <a id='tn-scutcheon'></a>scutcheon very clear. Two years ago last week, wasn’t
it, Caesar, when she died? Confound it! Are you going to stand

good care of Marse Jedge?”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: Caesar, you have overstepped all bounds. You have presumed
upon the leniency with which you have been treated to meddle
unpardonably. So you know what is in this satchel! Your long and
faithful service is some excuse, but—go home, Caesar—not another
word!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Caesar</i>: Marse Jedge, gimme dis hyar valise. Ah got a right,

miss that train. What’s the matter here?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: Well, Colonel, I’ve been having a little trouble. I came
in to get the liquor that I had in this suit-case—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Caesar</i> (<i>with gestures of amazement and confusion</i>): What’s dat
you say, Marse Jedge?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: I said the liquor that I had in this suit-case. What did
you think I had in it?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Caesar</i> (<i>staggered</i>): Ah—Ah—oh—Ah—dat is—(<i>recovering himself
suddenly</i>) Dat’s right, Marse Jedge, de liquor. Ah didn’t zacly
hear straight, Ah’s gittin so ole—mah ears is wusser an wusser—</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i> (<i>to Jennings</i>): Well, this infernally presumptuous old
nigger has been breaking up our arrangements. I don’t know how he
found out what I was doing—I had the liquor hid in that vault, and
was trying to sneak it out, but here he is, and he’s vetoed the proceedings.
He means right, and—well, I reckon he <i>is</i> right. He has
noticed that I’ve been indulging a little more than a gentleman
should, and he has laid for me some reaching arguments.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Well, I’ll be hornswoggled.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Judge</i>: I’m going to quit drinking. I’ve come to the conclusion
that a man can’t keep it up and be quite what he’d like to be—“pure
and fearless and without reproach”—that’s the way old Caesar
quoted it.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Jennings</i>: Well, I’ll have to admit that the old darkey’s argument
can’t conscientiously be overruled.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span><i>Judge</i>: Still (<i>with a ghost of a smile</i>) there are two quarts of
the finest old silk-velvet Bourbon in that satchel you ever wet your
lips with. Take it home, Caesar, and put it somewhere I can’t find it!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Caesar</i>: Yes, Marse Jedge; thank’ee, Cunnel Gwathmey. Ah
hopes you genlemen has a good fishin day. Looks to me like it promise
mighty fine weather—de sun sot red las night, an you know what
dat means fo fishermen’s luck. Ah members one time when de Jedge
an me was youngsters—(<i>the three of them go off, at right, in the
midst of the Negro’s chatter</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>wanders about distracted; goes to cashier’s drawer and
opens it</i>): It’s gone! It’s gone! The money isn’t here that ought to
be here. And they’ll blame me for it! Oh, why did I ever come into
a bank? What do I know about taking care of money? (<i>he stops and
gazes at Athol, who enters right, clad as in Act I</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i> (<i>drifts towards him, dreamlike, silent; at last she whispers</i>):
Will!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Athol! (<i>with intense distress</i>) Sweetheart, some of the
money is gone from the drawer, and they’re blaming me for it. You
know how it is—people take money out, and they’re supposed to put
in a slip, but they forget to do it and what can I do?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i>: Will, dear, I love you.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: They are going to put me in prison—five years, they’ve
sentenced me to. And when I come out, I’ll be an ex-convict. People
will brand me with it—I’ll never be able to escape!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i>: Will, dear.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>sobs</i>): Sweetheart, I can’t go to prison, oh, I can’t stand
it! I’m going to die! I’ll kill myself!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i> (<i>gently</i>): No, Will, you won’t do that. You know that I
love you. And there is Margaret—who would take care of her? I
can’t last much longer, you know.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Oh, God, I can’t stand being in prison—the things they’ll
do to me! They’ll handcuff me, and shave my head, and put me in
stripes—they may even beat me! I’ll come out a maniac!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i>: Whatever they do, you will stand it for my sake. And
you will come out, and start over, and be yourself. You know my
faith in you, Will—and you have to be the thing I have dreamed.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>with sudden intensity</i>): Listen, Athol, there is an easy
way to die; the thought of it haunts me—to die for the poor devils
in prison! That’s what I ought to do—take a stand against the graft
and cruelty, and let anything come that will!</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i> (<i>embraces him, tenderly, as if he were her child</i>): A man’s
wife learns to know him, Will. Listen; you will die many deaths, in
your imagination; but always you will live to die others.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i> (<i>yielding a little to her beguilement</i>): Ah, sweetheart,
if only I could have your guidance.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i> (<i>leads him to chair beside the desk, facing audience; she
kneels beside him</i>): You have it, Will—always; you have everything
you’ve ever had, and many things you’ve only dreamed. Precious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>gifts, you have—fancy, and tenderness—and merry words, a shining
flood. You will take them into prison with you, and bring them out
unharmed; and you will learn new things, new understanding, new
pity—and the future will be before you. You will find a way to help
people—your own way; to suggest a little kindness to them, a little
humor, in the hope that sometime it will become contagious.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I said those very words in the prison; I am always quoting
you.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i>: Once upon a time you told me about some foolish person
in New York who talked about the Four Hundred—those few who
really counted. You said you would write about the Four Million—they
were the ones who counted.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: I think of that now and then.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Athol</i>: Write about them, Will! Write <i>for</i> them! I see them,
eager, hungry, craving just the sort of pity mixed with laughter that
is your gift. Yes, I see them! Will! Will—look at them! (<i>she
points; a searchlight behind the scenes is suddenly turned upon the
audience through an aperture in the back drop; it plays here and there,
and Athol’s voice rises with excitement</i>) Faces! Faces! Millions of
faces—and all of them your lovers! Eager faces, shining, with gratitude,
with hope, with fun—all of them ready to cheer you, to shout
to you—to tell the affection they bear you! Go forth, Will Porter!
Do your work, and take your place as their story teller—the voice of
the Four Million!</p>

<p class='c013'>(<i>Dulcie enters at right; the little shop-girl, clad in pitiful imitation
finery; frail, emaciated, hungry in body and soul; she carries a
wreath of laurel</i>)</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Porter</i>: Who are you?</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Dulcie</i>: I am Dulcie, the little shop-girl. Mine is the Unfinished
Story, which you will finish. I have never had a true friend—not
among men; but you are my friend. (<i>she puts the wreath upon his

    <div><span class='large'><i>An Essay in Economic Interpretation</i></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Mammonart</i>” studies the artists from a point of
view entirely new; asking how they get their living,
and what they do for it; turning their pockets inside
out, seeing what is in them and where it
comes from.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Mammonart</i>” puts to painters, sculptors, poets,
novelists, dramatists and composers the question already
put to priests and preachers, editors and journalists,
college presidents and professors, school
superintendents and teachers: <span class='large'>WHO OWNS YOU,
AND WHY?</span></p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Mammonart</i>” examines art and literature as instruments
of propaganda and repression, employed
by ruling classes of the community; or as weapons
of attack, employed by new classes rising into power.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Mammonart</i>” challenges the great ones now
honored by critical authority and asks to what extent
they are servants of ruling-class prestige and
instruments of ruling-class safety.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Mammonart</i>” asserts that mankind is today under
the spell of utterly false conceptions of what
art is and should be; of utterly vicious and perverted
standards of beauty and dignity in all the
arts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Mammonart</i>” is a history of culture, and also a
battle-cry.</p>

<p class='c013'>When you read your daily paper, are you reading
facts or propaganda? And whose propaganda?</p>

<p class='c013'>Who furnishes the raw material for your thoughts
about life? Is it honest material?</p>

<p class='c013'>No man can ask more important questions than
these; and here for the first time the questions are
answered in a book.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first edition of this book, 23,000 copies, was
sold out two weeks after publication. Paper could
not be obtained for printing, and a carload of brown
wrapping paper was used. The printings to date
amount to 144,000 copies. The book is being published
in Great Britain and colonies, and in translations
in Germany, France, Holland, Norway, Sweden,
Denmark, Italy, Hungary and Japan.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='small'>Hermann Bessemer, in the “Neues Journal,” Vienna:</span></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='small'>“Upton Sinclair deals with names, only with names,
with balances, with figures, with documents, a truly stunning,
gigantic fact-material. His book is an armored
military train which with rushing pistons roars through
the jungle of American monster-lies, whistling, roaring,
shooting, chopping off with Berserker rage the obscene
heads of these evils. A breath-taking, clutching, frightful
book.”</span></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='small'>From the pastor of the Community Church, New York:</span></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='small'>“I am writing to thank you for sending me a copy of
your new book, ‘The Brass Check.’ Although it arrived
only a few days ago, I have already read it through, every
word, and have loaned it to one of my colleagues for reading.
The book is tremendous. I have never read a more
strongly consistent argument or one so formidably buttressed
by facts. You have proved your case to the handle.
I again take satisfaction in saluting you not only as a
great novelist, but as the ablest pamphleteer in America
today. I am already passing around the word in my church
and taking orders for the book.”—John Haynes Holmes.</span></p>

And whose propaganda?</p>

<p class='c013'>No man can ask more important questions than
these; and here for the first time the questions are
answered in a book.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='small'>H. L. MENCKEN on “The Goslings”: “I’d be recreant
to my vows at ordination if I did not commend his volume
unqualifiedly as excellent reading. It is, in fact, one of the
most interesting books I have got through for months. It
presents a vast mass of scandalous and amusing facts, it
sorts them out very deftly, and it is very well written.
Why he has had to publish it himself I can’t make out.
Are all the regular publishers idiots?”</span></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='small'>The Los Angeles “Times” on “The Goslings”: “As to
the truth of the charges, we have only the author’s word
for it.... One would think that if one-half of the charges
are true something should be done about it; on the other
hand, if they are not true, something should be done to
suppress the book.”</span></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='small'>From H. L. MENCKEN:</span></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='small'>“‘The Goose-Step’ came in at last yesterday afternoon,
and I fell on it last night. My very sincere congratulations.
I have read on and on with constant joy in the
adept marshalling of facts, the shrewd presentation of
personalities, the lively and incessant humor. It is not
only a fine piece of writing; it is also a sound piece of
research. It presents a devastating, but, I believe, thoroughly
fair and accurate picture of the American universities
today. The faults of ‘The Brass Check’ and ‘The
Profits of Religion’ are not in it. It is enormously more
judicial and convincing than either of those books. You
are here complaining of nothing. You simply offer the
bald and horrible facts—but with liveliness, shrewdness,
good humor. An appalling picture of a moral and mental
debasement! Let every American read it and ponder it!”</span></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='small'>A few questions considered in “The Goose-Step”: Do
you know the extent to which the interlocking directors
of railroads and steel and oil and coal and credit in the
United States are also the interlocking trustees of American
“higher” education? Do you think that our colleges
and universities should be modeled on the lines of our
government, or on the lines of our department-stores?
Do you know that eighty-five per cent of college and university
professors are dissatisfied with being managed by
floor-walkers? Do you know for how many different
actions and opinions a professor may lose his job? Do
you know how many professors have to do their own laundry?
Do you know why American college presidents with
few exceptions are men who do not tell the truth? Do
you know to what extent “social position” takes precedence
over scholarship in American academic life?</span></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='small'>A few of the institutions dealt with:</span></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='small'>The University of the House of Morgan; The University
of Lee-Higginson; The University of U. G. I.; The
Tiger’s Lair; The Bull-dog’s Den; The University of the
